# ERP Instances

The ERP.net service is a hosted ERP service. Accessing the data is done through ERP Instances. When you sign up at [erp.net](https://erp.net/), you can create and manage a new ERP Instance.

An ERP Instance is a tenant in the hosting environment. It is multi-company, e.g. it allows managing multiple related legal entities (companies) in one instance. You don't need to create separate instances for each managed company.

Each ERP Instance has a unique name. The instance can be accessed at: https://<<instance_name>>.my.erp.net

For example, the demonstration database, DEMODB, is located at:

> [https://demodb.my.erp.net](https://demodb.my.erp.net/)
