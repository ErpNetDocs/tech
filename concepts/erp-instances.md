# ERP instances

The @@name service is a hosted ERP service. Accessing the data is done through ERP instances. 

When you sign up at **[erp.net](https://erp.net/)**, you can create and manage a **new** instance. It's a tenant in a hosting environment, allowing the management of multiple related legal entities (companies) in one instance. You don't need to create separate instances per managed company.

Each instance has a unique **name** and can be accessed at *https://<<instance_name>>.my.erp.net*

For example, the demonstration database, DEMODB, is located at:

**[https://demodb.my.erp.net](https://demodb.my.erp.net/)**
