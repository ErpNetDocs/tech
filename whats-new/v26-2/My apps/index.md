# My Apps
**My Apps** is the collective name for a suite of interactive, standalone applications within the ERP.net Web Client. They provide a personalized workspace where users can access aggregated and complex data in a simple, intuitive way. As a core extension of the Social ERP concept, My Apps enhances productivity, collaboration, and everyday efficiency across the organization.

The My module consists of several interconnected applications—each functioning independently while remaining fully compatible with the rest of the ERP.net platform. These include:Groups, Dashboard, Notifications, Search, Calendar, Timeline, Tiles, Favorites, To Do, Documents, AI Assistant and Folders

In the sections that follow, you will find all new features and improvements introduced for these applications in ERP.net version 26.2.
