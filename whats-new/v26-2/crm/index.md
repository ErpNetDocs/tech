# CRM

## Notable features

### **1. Improved Opportunity → Offer Flow: Customer field now optional**

When creating an Offer from an Opportunity (via Run → Create Offer), the system no longer requires a pre-existing Customer record. This simplifies the process and removes the need to create a Customer entry prematurely.
Party information from the Opportunity is automatically transferred to the To Party field, allowing the Offer to be created quickly and efficiently. A formal Customer record is only needed later in the process, once the Offer is approved and moved to Released status.
This enhancement reduces unnecessary steps, minimizes confusion, and provides a more streamlined experience when working with Opportunities and Offers.


### **2. Automatic Customer Creation When an Offer Is Approved**

To streamline the offer approval process, the system now automatically creates a Customer record when an Offer is moved to Released (or directly to Completed) status. The newly created Customer is immediately linked back to the Offer through the Customer field.
All necessary data for creating the Customer is taken directly from the To Party information in the Offer, eliminating the need for users to manually create a Customer entry.
This enhancement reduces administrative work, prevents confusion, and ensures a smooth transition from potential client to confirmed customer — all in one seamless step.
