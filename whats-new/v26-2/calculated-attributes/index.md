# Calculated Attributes

User calculated attributes are user-defined objects that extend system entities. When a calculated attribute's value is requested, it is computed on the fly, in real time.

For an overview, see [Calculated Attributes overview](../../../advanced/calculated-attributes/index.md).

## Notable features

### 1. JavaScript support in calculated attributes
