## Other features

1. **Notes on order creation (Client Center)**  
   When creating a **New Order** in Client Center, users can now add a short **Notes** text directly in the **Order** tab. This is useful for delivery instructions, preferences, or other clarifications that should reach the fulfillment team immediately—without follow-up emails or calls. The field is optional and does not block order creation when left empty. Notes are stored in [General.Documents.Documents.DocumentNotes](https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/General.Documents.Documents.html#documentnotes).
