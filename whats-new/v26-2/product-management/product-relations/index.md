# Product relations

With the latest update, we‚Äôre introducing a new concept: _Product Relations_, bringing more flexibility, clarity, and automation to the way products are connected.
This functionality is implemented through two new tables:

üß© Product Relation Types ‚Äì define what kind of relationship exists between products (e.g., Replacement, Compatibility, Merchandising).
üîó Product Relations ‚Äì store the actual links between products (from ‚Üí to), including validity dates and quantity factors.

## What Does This Bring?

The new model allows the system to understand how products relate to each other ‚Äî not just by code or category, but by real business relationships:

üîÅ Replacement ‚Äì automatically suggest substitute products when one is discontinued or out of stock.
üß† Merchandising ‚Äì provide intelligent product recommendations such as upsell, cross-sell, or similar products.
‚öôÔ∏è Fitment ‚Äì ensure only compatible components are used in configurations or production.
üß± Generic ‚Äì define your own custom relation types for unique business cases.

## Why It Matters

These new tables make product data management more flexible, centralized, and extensible.
Instead of separate, disconnected structures (for replacements, accessories, or compatibility), we now have a unified model that can evolve without database or code changes.

This turns Product Management into a more powerful tool for:

- process optimization (faster order handling and support),
- improved customer experience through smarter product suggestions,
- and deeper insight into product relationships and lifecycle data.

üß≠ In short:
The new Product Relations transform Product Management from a static catalog into a dynamic network of product knowledge, enabling automation, recommendations, and data-driven decisions across the business.
