### Other features
**1. New System-Calculated Attributes: “Total Line Amount” and “Amount To Pay”**

Our latest update introduces two powerful system-calculated attributes — “Total Line Amount” and “Amount To Pay” — for all Invoice and Sales documents.
With these new fields, users can instantly view key financial figures directly within the document form or navigator, without needing to perform any manual calculations.
This improvement streamlines financial verification, enhances accuracy, and saves valuable time when managing transactions — helping you stay focused on what matters most: running your business efficiently.

**2. Access to object system information**

System information provides special data for the currently observed object, as its ID for example. It is now easier to access that through the menu, as a side panel System info.
