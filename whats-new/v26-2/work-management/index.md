# Work Management

The **Work Management** module centralizes the entire work lifecycle—from planning and assignment to tracking and completion—into one integrated system. It supports everything from simple To Dos to complex projects, tying together roles, resources, workflows, and time tracking with full traceability. Work Management also includes reporting, auditing, and AI-assisted training tools. It consists of four submodules: **Projects, AI Training, Classic Projects, and To Do**, all receiving major enhancements in v.26.2.

## Other features
### 1. New rule for closing Cases

A Case can be set to CLOSED only if all related Tasks (Todos) are COMPLETED.
If there are unfinished Tasks, the system will block the action and prompt the user to complete them first.

This revocable rule helps prevent incomplete work and improves process consistency.
