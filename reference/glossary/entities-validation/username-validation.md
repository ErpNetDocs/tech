# Username Validation


The rules for naming a user are:

- Usernames **can** contain both lowercase and uppercase characters.
- Usernames **can** contain alphanumeric characters.
- Usernames **can** contain underscore and hyphens.
- They **cannot** contain spaces.
- They **cannot** contain two underscores, two hyphens or two spaces in a row.
- They **cannot** contain an underscore, hyphen or space at the start or the end.
 
 
These are **valid** usernames:

- username
- userName
- user.name
- username4
- user_name
- user-name
 
 
These are **invalid** usernames:

-  username (there is space in the beginning)
- _username
- -username
- user__name
- user  name
- user–name
- username_
- username  (there is space in the end)
- username-
- user name
