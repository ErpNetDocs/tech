# Username validation


The rules for naming a user are:

- Usernames **can** contain both lowercase and uppercase characters.
- Usernames **can** contain alphanumeric characters.
- Usernames **can** contain underscore and hyphens.
- They **cannot** contain spaces.
- They **cannot** contain two underscores, two hyphens or two spaces in a row.

These are **valid** usernames:
