# Username Validation


The rules for naming a user are:

- Usernames can contain both lowercase and uppercase characters.
- Usernames can contain alphanumeric characters.
- Usernames can contain underscore and hyphens.
- Cannot contain spaces.
- Cannot contain two underscores, two hyphens or two spaces in a row.
- Cannot contain an underscore, hyphen or space at start or end.
 
 
For example, these are valid usernames:

- username
- userName
- user.name
- username4
- user_name
- user-name
 
 
Invalid usernames could be:

-  username (there is a ' ' in the beginning)
- _username
- -username
- user__name
- user  name
- userâ€“name
- username_
- username  (there is a ' ' in the end)
- username-
- user name
