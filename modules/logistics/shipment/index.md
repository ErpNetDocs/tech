# Shipment 

The Shipment module is designed to assist in managing the shipping process for purchased stock. 

Upon purchasing stock, a Store Order is generated, followed by a Store Transaction. 

Subsequently, a Shipment Order is created based on the Store Order, facilitating the shipment of the stock.
