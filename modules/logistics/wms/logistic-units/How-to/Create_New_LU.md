> Choosing a logistic unit type remains optional. You can create a unit without one. 

Once you've completed the previous steps, a separate page will open, where you need to fill out several fields:

* **Serial Code** - Serial code of the unit (required).
  
* **Logistic Unit Type** - If you've selected a unit type, it will be automatically specified here.
  
* **Expected Weight** - This is the expected weight of the unit in the measurement unit specified in its type.
  
* **Measured Weight** - This is the actual weight of the unit in the measurement unit specified in its type.
  
* **Cargo Type** - General type of the cargo that will be used for the unit. Select one from the drop-down menu.
  
* **Notes** - Additional notes can be added here.
  
* **Represented As Product** - When the logistics unit is also a tradeable item, this field specifies the product used to trade the unit.
  
* **Active Status** - Check this box to make the logistic unit active.

When you are ready, click on the **Save and reload** button to finish the creation process
