## P01 - Product Code Parser

This parser recognizes product part numbers and additional product codes. 
Once triggered, the parser tries to find a product with the string specified in the barcode. If it finds a product, then it searches for an unexecuted Warehouse Order Line with this product. If there is a such line – it starts its execution. If not – it moves to the next active parser.

A detailed description of the parser’s action:
1. Try to find a product with the same Part Number as the scanned barcode. If the search is successful, then go to step 3. Else go to step 2.
2. Try to find a Product with the same additional Product Code as the scanned barcode. If the search is successful, then go to step 3. Else go to step 5.
3. Search for an unexecuted Warehouse Order Line with the recognized product. If there is a such line, go to step 4. Else go to step 5.
4. Automatically start the line execution of the best matching line.
5. Move to the next active parser.
