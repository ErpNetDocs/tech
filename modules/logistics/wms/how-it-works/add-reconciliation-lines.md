# Add reconciliation lines from the WMS module


Knowing the exact number of products in a given warehouse location is crucial for keeping order. However, there are often differences between the expected and the actual quantity of a product, which occur during reconciliation. <br /> In such cases, you need to add **reconciliation lines** to the main reconciliation document. 

> [NOTE!]
> 
> Warehouse locations are reconciled to determine how many products are being stored there. In addition, the difference between expected and actual quantity is calculated as well.

## Adding reconciliation lines

Once differences in product quantity are established, they need to be accounted. For that purpose, you need to use the _WMS module_.

To begin, create a new reconciliation document from the **Logistcs --> Inventory** section.

Fill it with the necessary information, including the **default store** in which the inventarisation is done, and save the document.

To add reconciliation lines from the WMS module to an existing document, click the **play** **button** at the upper-left corner of the screen. This will check exactly which calculations havenâ€™t been accounted yet, and will load lines for manual accounting.

Define the **period** on which you want the data to be based (in days), and click **OK**.

In the _Lines_ section, unaccounted lines with differences in product quantity that occurred during reconciliation will be listed.
