## GS1 Barcodes
GS1 barcodes are a type of barcode used in retail and supply chain operations to identify items. They are used in many countries and are based on the international GS1 standard. These barcodes use a list of different application identifiers (AI) to encode additional data into the barcode such as quantity, lot, expiration date, serial number, and other attributes.

ERP.net supports GS1 Barcodes and recognizes a number of GS1 identifiers using different [Barcode Parsers](how-it-works/barcode-parsers/index.md).

For more information, see the documentation of the specific parser:
* [P02: GS1 - Single Product](how-it-works/barcode-parsers/p02.md)
* [P03: GS1 - SSCC](how-it-works/barcode-parsers/p03.md)
