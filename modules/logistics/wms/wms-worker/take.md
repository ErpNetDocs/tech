# Take

In the "Orders" menu of the WMS Worker, two categories are displayed: „ASSIGNED TO ME“ and “UNASSIGNED”.

The <b>“Take”</b> function allows the warehouse worker to select a Warehouse Order (WO) from the “UNASSIGNED” list and assign it to himself. The WO will quickly and easily appear in their „ASSIGNED TO ME“ task list for execution.


> [!NOTE]
> All Warehouse Orders in the "UNASSIGNED" list are in "Planned" or "Firm planned" state.


From the order navigator, by pressing the <b>“Take”</b> button in the bottom left corner of the screen of the corresponding WO, the warehouse worker takes the chosen unassigned order.
