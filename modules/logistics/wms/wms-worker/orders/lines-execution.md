# Lines Execution

The line execution starts when we press the <b>Execute</b> button in the lines list or when we Scan a code and a matching line is found.
The execution guides the worker trough the applicable screens. The applicable screens are ....

## Location

The option to scan the location of the product will appear. There is already a suggested location that can be used if needed by clicking the <b>Use</b> button next to it:

Click on the desired location to make the selection.

## Product

After selecting the location, a field for scanning the Product will appear. You could use the product suggested by the system by clicking the <b>Use</b> button. The interface allows for the product to be replaced if needed.
Even if the product is not replaced, it still needs to be scanned.

## Variant


## Lot

If the product has a Lot, the system will ask you to enter it. There could be a suggestion you can use again. The Lot can be scanned. However, if it does not have a barcode, it can be entered manually as long as it already exists in the system. You can check the AVAILABILITY section as well, if needed:

## Serial

Depending on the product, you might be asked for its serial number, with or without suggested value to use and with AVAILABILITY section again:

Once the serial number is selected, there is no need to fill in the Quantity field and it can be skipped.

## Quantity

The Quantity field allows the employee to select the unit and quantity of the product:
