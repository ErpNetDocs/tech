On this screen, you will find three tabs dedicated to line execution:

-	**All** - shows all lines of the order regardless of whether they have been executed or not
-	**Remaining** - shows rows that have not yet been executed
-	**Executed** - shows the rows that have already been executed

All lines contain information about the requested product and its quantity.

-	**Task** - shows the main task
-	**Loc** - shows the location of the product
-	**Prd** - shows the product itself
-	**Total/Exec** - shows what quantity of the product needs to be procure compared to what quantity has already been executed
- **Ð•xec** - a check mark that appears only if the line is fully executed

More details about each line, e.g. the full name of the product, the ordered lot, variant, serial number, etc. can be accessed via the line's respective **info button**. If an execution has already taken place, the **Info** screen will include details about it as well.

![Info button](pictures/info_wms.png)

At the top of the screen, there is a general **Scan field**. 

When scanning a value in this field, a matching unexecuted line is searched through the lines list. If such a line is found, its **[execution](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/logistics/wms/wms-worker/orders/lines-execution.html)** is started automatically. 

![Scan field](pictures/scan_wms.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The scanned value recognition is done by **[Barcode Parsers](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/logistics/wms/how-it-works/barcode-parsers/index.html)** such as Product Code and GS1 - Single Product. <br>
> The list of currently active parsers can be seen by accessing the vertical three-dot **Menu button** at the bottom of the app.

At the bottom of the screen, there are buttons for managing the order:

- **Stop** - terminates the order 
- **Execute** - allows for **[line execution](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/logistics/wms/wms-worker/orders/lines-execution.html)**; will change to **Complete Order** when all lines have been executed
- **Menu** - allows access to several additional functions like **[Suggest Routing](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/logistics/wms/wms-worker/orders/picking-routes.html?q=suggest%20routing)**, **Active Parsers**, and **Refresh**, which will instantly refresh the contents of the order.
