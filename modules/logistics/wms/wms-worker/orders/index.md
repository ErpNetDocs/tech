# Orders

This menu provides information on upcoming warehouse orders.

![Orders](pictures/assigned_unassigned.png)

The order navigator is divided into two categories:

-	**ASSIGNED TO ME** - the warehouse worker who is logged into their own account can check the orders they have for execution
-	**UNASSIGNED** - orders that are not assigned to a specific worker and can be executed by anyone who can take them

Above the list is a **search bar** that can be used to filter orders. You can search by scanning or entering an order number, party name (if any), or document type.

The **total** number of orders can be checked at the bottom of the page.

## Order details

The lines contain information about the requested product and its quantity.

-	**Task** - shows the main task
-	**Loc** - location of the product
-	**Prd** - shows the product itself
-	**Total** - shows what quantity of the product needs to be procured
-	**Remain** - shows what quantity of the product has already been executed; the remaining quantity that needs to be to be procured is the difference between Total and Remain.

More details about each line, e.g. the full name of the product, the ordered lot, variant, serial number, etc. can be accessed via the line's respective **info button**. If an execution has already taken place, the **Info** screen will include details about it as well.

At the top of the screen, there is a general **Scan field**. 

When scanning a value in this field, a matching unexecuted line is searched through the lines list. If such a line is found, its execution is started automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> The scanned value recognition is done by **[Barcode Parsers](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/logistics/wms/how-it-works/barcode-parsers/index.html?q=barcode%20pars)** such as Product Code and GS1 - Single Product. <br>
> The list of currently active parsers can be seen by accessing the vertical three-dot **Menu button** at the bottom of the app.
