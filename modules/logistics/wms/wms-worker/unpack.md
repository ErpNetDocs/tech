# Unpack 

The **Unpack** menu allows you to unpack the Contents of an [Logistic Unit (LU)](xref:LU).

Note that this menu is used to unpack the entire LU. If you want to unpack only part of the LU contents, you can use the Move menu, where you can uncheck the "Move the whole logistic unit" option.

To Unpack a LU, first, select or scan the desired Logistic Unit:
