## Warehouse workers

Warehouse workers are the people who are performing tasks within a warehouse. 

They are set up in the **Workers** panel, where you can create and modify records for each of the persons working in the particular warehouse.

Having a worker set up defines which Warehouses will be visible for the user upon login into the @wms-worker app. 

The users only sees the Warehouses in which they are specified as workers.

This means that one user might be connected to a multiple warehouses and respectively can be related to more than one worker definitions - one for each warehouse.

The connection between the user and the worker is performed through the Person field - the Person specified in the worker/workers and in the user that is going to be used to log into the app should be the same.
