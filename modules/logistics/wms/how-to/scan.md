# Use the Scan field

Each time you wish to fulfill an order, you must scan the corresponding product the exact number of times specified by the order quantity.

## Scan an item single time 

To scan a single item, simply enter the product code into the **Scan** field, then proceed by clicking the **blue arrow** button.

> You can enhance clarity by adding the multiplication operator "*" after the number in the **Scan** field.

## Adding the number of times a product will be scanned 

When scanning a product multiple times, it might be more convenient in certain situations to input the quantity over several entries.

To do that, enter a number in the **Scan** field and click the **blue arrow** button. Then, repeat the operation one or more times. 

This way, the multiple numbers entered will be summed together, resulting in the final quantity for scanning the product.
