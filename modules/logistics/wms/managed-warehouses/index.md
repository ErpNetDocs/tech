# Managed Warehouses 

Managed warehouses are visual representations of complex storage facilities that necessitate efficient inventory management. 

In ERP.net, they are organized into various locations and zones, each enforcing its own policies and consisting of one or more workers. 

This structured approach allows for precise tracking, better organization and streamlined logistics within the managed warehouse.

### Navigation 

To access your managed warehouses, navigate to the **Managed Warehouses** panel of the **WMS** section.

## Warehouse components 

The building blocks of a managed warehouse are established during its creation. 

They can be subsequently modified if the warehouse experiences any changes.
