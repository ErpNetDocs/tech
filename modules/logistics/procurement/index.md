## Documents 

### Purchase Invoice 

To initiate a purchase request, use the **Purchase Invoice**. Within this document, specify the desired delivery warehouse and select the supplier responsible for fulfilling the order. Depending on the chosen supplier, additional options such as credit limits and delivery times may be available.
