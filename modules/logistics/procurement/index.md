## Documents 

### Purchase Invoice 

To initiate a purchase request, use the **Purchase Invoice**. Within this document, specify the desired delivery warehouse and select the supplier responsible for fulfilling the order. Depending on the chosen supplier, additional options such as credit limits and delivery times may be available.

### Purchase Order 

**Purchase Orders** are documents sent to suppliers to notify them of an order for goods or services. They serve as official authorization for warehouse workers to accept approved purchases.
