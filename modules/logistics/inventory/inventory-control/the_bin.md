# **How to Use the Bin in Inventory Control**

In our Inventory Control module, the bin plays a crucial role in managing product counts. There are two types of bins used in all operations, both accessible in the **info** panel:

* Delete-all Bin (Large Bin) and
* Delete-row Bin (Small Bin)

## Using the Delete-all bin 

The "large bin" is located at the top, on the product row. It is used to delete all counts and executions for a specific product, marking it as unexecuted or not counted at all. The process is similar for all operations like Receive, Issue, Scrap, Transfer, Quick reconcile and Planned reconcile.

  **Steps:**
  
Let say you execute a Receive operation of an Order consisting of three lines - products X, Y and Z. Each line has been executed as seen in the Executed tab and in the Executed field.
You decide to delete all executed quantities for product X:

1. Navigate to the Info tab of product X.
2. Locate the large bin at the top of the product row.
3. Click on the bin icon -> A pop-up message appears to confirm deletion.
4. Choose Delete to confirm.
   
  **Result:**
+ The quantity for product X in the Executed field is deleted
+ The row related to this product in tab Executed is removed.
+ After deletion, it appears as if the product was never executed.

Another example at operation Planned Reconcile, in which you count 50 pcs of product X and 20 pcs of product Y. In field Counted is entered the quantity for each product and in tab Counted are registered the rows for the counted products. You decide to delete all counts for product X. Execute the forementioned steps (1-4). As a result all counted quantity for product X is deleted as if never counted. If you check the records in panel Counts in Reconciliation document, you will see that the line is also removed from there.

## Using the Delete-row bin

The "small" bin is used to delete individual product count rows at all IC operations. It is helpful with products having lots or variants, allowing users to delete distributed quantities for specific lots or variants. For example, if a scanned quantity is spread across multiple lots, users can now remove the count for a chosen lot without affecting others.Â 




By using these bin functionalities effectively, you can ensure accurate inventory management while maintaining flexibility in operations.
