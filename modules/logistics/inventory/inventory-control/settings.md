# Settings

This section lets you decide what kind of **document** will be created following each of these actions:

* **Receive**
* **Issue**
* **Transfer**
* **Scrap**
* **Reconcile**

It's crucial to link the right template to its respective action **before** beginning to do anything within Inventory Control.

### Configuration

If you tap on the **downward arrows** of any of the available options, you'll be taken to a list of your existing document types.

It's possible to link any template to either the receive, issue, scrap, transfer or reconcile operation. 

One and the same document type can be used for **multiple** operations.
