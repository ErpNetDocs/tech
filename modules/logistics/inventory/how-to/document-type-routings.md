# Use the Document Type from Routings to create a new document

In the **Inventory Control** system, when creating a new document, both the settings in **Inventory Control** and the **Document Routes** defined in the corresponding **Store Order** are considered. 

This ensures that the type of **Transaction** defined in the **Document Route** is considered, along with the predefined settings in **Inventory Control**. 

This feature specifically applies to the **Receive** and **Issue** functionalities, providing a comprehensive approach to selecting the appropriate document type based on multiple criteria.

## Validation Process

1. **Document Route Filtering**: When creating the **transaction**, the system will filter the **Document Routes** based on the following fields in the **Document TypesFormRoutings** panel of the **Store Orders** data type:
   - **ProcessEvent**: Must be "Change of state".
   - **ConditionStatesBitMask**: Must include "Released".
   - **Destination DocumentType**: Must be a document of the data type "**Transactions**".

2. **Route Activity Timing**: At the moment of creating the **transaction**, the routeâ€™s activity must fall within the period specified by the **Activation Date** and **Deactivation Date** fields. It is important to note that both fields can also be empty.

3. **Additional Conditions**:
   - **IsActive**: Must be "True".
   - **ConditionEnterpriseCompany**: Must match either the Store order's **EnterpriseCompany** or be empty.
   - **AllowedGenerationTypes**: Must be set to "**Only Manually**".

After filtering, you need to retain only the information about the **Document Type** from the remaining **routes**.

## Cases Post Filtering and Considering Inventory Control Settings

1. **No Valid Result from Document Routes and No Document Type in Inventory Control Settings**:
   - If no valid **Document Type** is returned from the **Document Routes** and there is no **Document Type** selected in **Inventory Control** for the current function (**Receive/Issue**), an error should be thrown: "**No document type selected**".
   - Currently, this error is thrown if no **Document Type** is selected in **Inventory Control**. Post-development, this error should be thrown only if no valid **Document Type** is found in the **Document Routes**.

2. **No Valid Result from Document Routes but Document Type Specified in Inventory Control Settings**:
   - If no valid **Document Type** is returned from the **Document Routes** but a **Document Type** is specified in **Inventory Control** for the current function (**Receive/Issue**), then a **transaction** of the **Document Type** specified in **Inventory Control** should be created.

3. **Only One Valid Result from Document Routes**:
   - If only one result is returned from the **Document Routes** (or multiple results all pointing to the same **Document Type**), that **Document Type** is selected regardless of **Inventory Control** settings.

4. **Multiple Valid Results from Document Routes**:
   - If multiple different results are returned from the **Document Routes**, a selection menu should be displayed with a dropdown list containing all returned results from the **Document Routes** plus the **Document Type** specified in **Inventory Control**. The dropdown list should have a default value.
   - The default value in the dropdown list is determined as follows:
     - If at least one of the returned results matches the **Document Type** specified in **Inventory Control**, that **Document Type** is chosen as the default.
     - If none of the returned results match the **Document Type** specified in **Inventory Control** or if no **Document Type** is specified in **Inventory Control**, the default value is the **Document Type** with the smallest **Code** value among the **routes** (**DocumentType.Code**).

**Example Scenario:**
- You have specified "**Store Receipt Transaction**" as the **Document Type** in **Inventory Control Settings**.
- There are 11 defined **document routes** under "**Store Order for Inventory Control**," out of which 8 are invalid based on the specified filters.

After filtering, 3 valid **routes** remain, each with a different **Document Type** from the **Transactions** data type, none matching the type specified in **Inventory Control**.

1. Access **Inventory Control > Warehouse / Receive**.
2. Open **StoreOrder for Inventory Control - 00001**.
