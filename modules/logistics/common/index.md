# Common 

This submodule allows you to define **logistics units** and their **types**.

These units are subsequently employed across other submodules, ensuring consistency and efficiency in all logistics-related processes.

### Logistics unit types

Before you set up a logistics unit, you can optionally define its **type**. 

This is a predefined category that specifies the characteristics of the unit that will be used in the handling and transporting of goods, such as pallets, containers, or crates.

### Logistics units

Regardless of whether you have a type set, you can define as many logistic units as your warehouse needs. 

One unit represents a combination of products designated for transportation and/or storage within the supply chain.
