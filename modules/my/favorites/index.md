# Favorites

The Favorites screen allows users to build a personalized list of frequently accessed entities within @@name. This includes customers, campaigns, product groups, documents, or any other business entities. By marking items as favorites, you can easily access them from one place and receive notifications about relevant updates or events.

Favorites are context-aware and can include both top-level entities (e.g., Customers or Campaigns) as well as individual records (e.g., specific companies, opportunities, or documents).

## Key features

### Centralized access

### Notifications

- **Campaigns** – marketing or sales campaigns you track.
