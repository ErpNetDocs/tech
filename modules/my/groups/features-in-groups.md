#  Features in Groups

Groups is a sub-section of **My** that provides a convenient platform for effortless communication, document exchange, task scheduling, and assignment among you and your colleagues. 

Groups are created by an **Admin** in the platform when they are needed, between people in the same company. 

## Chat 

The **Chat** tab facilitates rapid communication among group participants. 

It offers standard industry features such as message previewing and sending, reacting to and replying to messages from others, and even editing one's messages.

## Calendar 

The Calendar tab enables authorized members to create and view a range of events and meetings visible to the entire group. 

Any group activities you create or participate in will also be reflected in your **[Calendar](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/calendar.html)**.

### Create a new activity 

Use the **Create** button to create a new activity. 

Choose the type of activity you want to create from the dropdown list.

To create a new activity you need to fill a form with information about the activity and the participants in it.  

Once you filled every field, click **Save and reload** and the activity will be added to the calendar.

### Business week labels

The group Calendar makes use of a "Business Week" numbering logic which is used to count the number of weeks in a year through a custom implementation of the **[ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)**.

You can read more about how it works **[here](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/calendar.html#business-week-numbering)**.

### Activity access

Group activities where you are not a **Participant**, **Responsible Party** or **Owner** will still appear in the Calendar of the group you are a member of, but **NOT** in your **[personal Calendar](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/calendar.html)**. 

If you're not a member of a group, its activities will not be shown in your Calendar, nor can be accessible in any other way. Even if you once were a member and were subsequently removed from that group, all access to its activities is automatically revoked.

Below, you can see how the **My Calendar** interface looks when group activites are automatically synced from the social group a user is part of. One event in which they are not a Participant, nor an Owner or Responsible Party is missing.

## To Do 

The **To Do** tab showcases tasks assigned to both yourself and fellow group members, allowing you to mark those ready for completion. 

With **Member** or **Admin** permissions, you can create new tasks and assign them to others. 

Any to-dos added or assigned to you will also be visible in your personal Do space.
