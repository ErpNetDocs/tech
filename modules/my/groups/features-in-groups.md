#  Features in Groups

Groups is a sub-section of **My** that provides a convenient platform for effortless communication, document exchange, task scheduling, and assignment among you and your colleagues. 

Groups are created by an **admin** in the platform when they are needed, between people in the same company. 

## Chat 

The **Chat** feature facilitates rapid communication among group participants. 

It offers standard industry features such as message previewing and sending, reacting to and replying to messages from others, and even editing one's messages.
