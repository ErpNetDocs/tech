# My Calendar

The **ERP.net Calendar** is a powerful time-management tool, allowing you to efficiently organize, monitor and synchronize your personal activities, events and tasks. 

It also sums up **group** activities from the social groups you take part in, whenever you are marked as the responsible person, organizer, or a participant. 

## Navigation 

You can find your personal **Calendar** in the **My** module.
