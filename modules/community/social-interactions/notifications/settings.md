# Notification settings

These settings allow users to specify which notifications they want to receive. They can also specify whether the notifications should be sent in-app, by mail or by sms.

- A setting is for a single user, for a single notification class.

- Only whole notification classes can be set up. Currently, there is no support for muting specific notification types.

- A setting determines whether the user should receive:

   - Notification - these are the in-app [notifications](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/index.html).
   - Email - the user should receive email on their primary email.
   - Sms - the user should receive SMS on their primary phone number.
   
- For more information about notification types and classes, see **[Notifications](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/index.html)**.
