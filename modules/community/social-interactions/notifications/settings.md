# Notification Settings

Notification settings allow the users to specify which notifications they want to receive. They can also specify whether the notifications should be sent in-app, by mail or by sms.

- The setting is for a single user, for a single notification class.
- Only whole notification classes can be set up. Currently, there is no support for muting only specific notification types.
- The setting specifies whether the user should receive:
   - Notification - this is the in-app notifications, governed by **[Notifications](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/index.md)**.
   - Email - the user should receive email on their primary email
   - Sms - the user should receive SMS on their primary phone number.
- For more information about notification types and classes, see **[Notifications](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/index.md)**.
