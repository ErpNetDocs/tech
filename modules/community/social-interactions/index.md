# Social interactions

This module represents the social interactions between internal and external users, just like in social networks like Facebook.

- The users join **[social groups](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/community/social-interactions/social-groups.md)**.
 
- Each **[social post](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/community/social-interactions/social-posts.md)** is made in a group. There is no personal space like in Facebook.

- Each post can contain **[social comments](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/community/social-interactions/social-comments.md)**, replies and **reactions**. These can also be attached to any data object in the system.

- **[Notifications](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/index.md)** are special data records that contain information about a single notification for a user.

- **[Notification settings](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/settings.md)** allow users to specify which notifications they want to receive. They can also specify whether the notifications should be sent in-app, by mail or by sms.
