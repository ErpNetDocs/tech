# Social interactions

This module represents the social interactions between internal and external users, just like in social networks like Facebook.

- The users are joined to [social groups](social-groups.md).
 
- Each [social post](social-posts.md) is made in a group. There is no personal space like in Facebook.

- Each post can contain [social comments](social-comments.md), replies and [reactions](social-reactions.md). These can also be attached to any data object in the system.

- @notifications are special data records that contain information about a single notification for a user.

- @notification-settings allow users to specify which notifications they want to receive. They can also specify whether the notifications should be sent in-app, by mail or by sms.
