# Social interactions

This module represents the social interactions between internal and external users, just like in social networks like Facebook.

- The users join [social groups](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/community/social-interactions/social-groups.html).
 
- Each [social post](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/community/social-interactions/social-posts.html) is made in a group. There is no personal space like in Facebook.

- Each post can contain [social comments](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/community/social-interactions/social-comments.html), replies and **reactions**. These can also be attached to any data object in the system.

- [Notifications](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/index.html) are special data records that contain information about a single notification for a user.

- [Notification settings](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/community/social-interactions/notifications/settings.html) allow users to specify which notifications they want to receive. They can also specify whether the notifications should be sent in-app, by mail or by sms.
