# Social groups

The social groups are the primary areas (circles) where [social interactions](index.md) occur.

- Social groups have resemblance to Facebook groups.

- Unlike FB groups, [social posts](social-posts.md) are always grouped. There is no personal space, unless a personal group is defined.

#### Important attributes:

- **Code** - this is the unique code of the group. It is also used as a ***slug*** which forms part of the URL for the group, posts, etc.

- **Name** - the universal name of the group.
