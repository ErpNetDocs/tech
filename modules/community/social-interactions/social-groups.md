# Social Groups

The social groups are the primary areas (circles), where the social interactions occur.

- Social groups have resemblance to Facebook groups.
- Unlike FB groups, the social posts are always in a group. There is no personal space, unless a personal group is defined.

### Important Attributes

- **Code** - this is the unique code of the group. But the code is also used as a ***slug***. The slug is used to form a part of the URL for the group, posts, etc.
- **Name** - multi-language name of the group.
