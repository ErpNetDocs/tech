**Overview of User Roles in the System**

The system supports multiple user roles, each designed to manage access and permissions for different levels of functionality. These roles are integral to maintaining data security and ensuring the appropriate allocation of responsibilities within the platform. The following user roles are defined:

1. **Normal Users**

   - Standard role with limited access to functionalities and panels.

2. **Administrators**

   - Full access to all system functionalities, including security and permissions management.

3. **Everybody**

   - A general role applied to all users for basic system operations.

4. **Power Users**

   - A role with elevated permissions, specifically designed to fill the gap between Normal Users and Administrators. This role allows for greater functionality without granting full administrative privileges.
