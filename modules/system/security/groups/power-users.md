# Power Users

**Power users** is a system-defined group type providing select users with privileges elevated above those of the **Normal user-definable group** type but below the **Administrators** type. Its primary purpose is to allow users to access the **Access Permissions** panel of the **Security** section, as well as have the option to make this panel visible for normal users.

   Unlike the **Administrators** group type, there is no checkbox or automated assignment process.
