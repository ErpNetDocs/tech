# **System Permissions**

The **System Permissions** panel is a central hub for managing user access to various functionalities across the platform. 

It allows administrators to grant or restrict permissions by assigning specific **keys** to groups or individual users.

These keys define what actions users can perform and which sections they can access. 

### Key functionalities

Below, you can find a brief list of key functionalities:

- **Permission Assignment:** Administrators can assign or revoke specific permission keys for groups or individual users.
- **Role-Based Access:** Keys can be applied to predefined groups, such as Administrators, Power Users, and Normal Users.
- **Visibility Control:** Keys determine if users can access certain parts of the platform such as the **Security (Access Permissions)** panel.

  For instance, determining the visibility of that panel is achieved with the **[Manage Access Permissions key](manage-access-permissions.md)**.
