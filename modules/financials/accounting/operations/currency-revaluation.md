# Currency revaluation algorithm

This topic describes the currency revaluation algorithm of accounts have balances in a currency other than the base currency when the revalution is performed using accounting operations.



## Input data 

   - an accounting Operation document
   - a list of Accounts - it is derived from the accounts indicated in the lines of the accounting template set up for the Operation document, where "Amount Column Name" == "Debit Exchange Difference" OR "Credit Exchange Difference"
   - Date of revaluation - it is derived from the Document Date of Operation
   - Currency directory - it is derived from the Currency Directory set in Operation
   - Accounting vouchers

## The algorithm action:

1. Get all currencies included in the Currency directory

2. Calculate Balance Ð¸ BalanceBase for the Date of revaluation for each Account, Currency, Item Key, CostCenter, ProfitCenter and ReferencedDocument.

   1.1. If [CurrencyValuationMethod](https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/Finance.Accounting.Accounts.html#currencyvaluationmethod) != Balance_Reference_Document.

     Then data is grouped by Account, Currency, Item Key, CostCenter, ProfutCenter. (ReferencedDocument = NULL).

   1.2. If [CurrencyValuationMethod](https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/Finance.Accounting.Accounts.html#currencyvaluationmethod) = Balance_Reference_Document

     Then data is grouped by Account, Currency, Item Key, CostCenter, ProfutCenter and ReferencedDocument.


2. Calculate the Amount in base currency of the Exchange difference for each group
   <br/> **`Amount = RoundAmount(BaseCurrency, Balance * CurrencyDirectoryLine.RateMultiplier / CurrencyDirectoryLine.RateDivisor) - BalanceBase)`**
    
> **_NOTE:_** If (templateline.AmountColumnName == Debit_Exchange_Differenc && Amount > 0) OR (templateline.AmountColum_Name == Credit_Exchange_Difference && Amount < 0), then it is considered that Amount = 0

3. Create an Accounting voucher with the calculated base currency amounts of the differences for each group.
   <br/> Amount (Currency, Account, ItemKey, CostCenter, ProfitCenterI, ReferencedDocument)
