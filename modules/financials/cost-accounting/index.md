# Cost

Costs represent the monetary value of resources consumed during an enterpriseâ€™s operations. 

In @@name, the **Cost** submodule supports the management of cost **calculation**, **allocation**, and **distribution**, ensuring that all incurred costs are accurately assigned to products, departments, or cost centers. It provides the framework for cost accounting within @@name, allowing organizations to maintain precise control over production and service expenses.

## Structure

The page includes documents for performing cost calculations and distributions, together with setup elements that define allocation rules, cost templates, and types.

### Documents & Operations

| Document / Operation | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calculations**     | Represents a single cost calculation and allocation run. Each calculation uses a defined **Cost Template** to determine how costs are gathered and distributed among cost objects.                  |
| **Distributions**    | Used to perform cost distribution for a specific period and store. It defines cost inputs, weighting factors, and distribution results according to the configured cost types and allocation rules. |

### Setup

| Setup                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allocation Models** | User-defined models specifying how costs are allocated across cost centers or activities.                                                                                              |
| **Templates**         | Define the structure and logic of cost calculations. Templates determine how costs are calculated and allocated.      |
| **Types**             | Define individual categories or classifications of costs (e.g., Labor, Transport, Packaging, Duties and Taxes). Each type can be activated or deactivated according to business needs. |
