# Fixed assets

The **Fixed Assets** submodule is responsible for managing the full lifecycle of an enterprise's tangible long-term assets â€” from acquisition and capitalization to valuation, depreciation, and retirement. 

It ensures compliance with both accounting and tax requirements by maintaining separate **valuation models** and automating the calculation of **depreciation** according to the selected **methods**.

## Structure

The page provides documents for registering and processing asset events, together with master data definitions and configuration elements that determine valuation and depreciation logic.

### Documents and Operations

| Document / Operation          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acquire and Retire Orders** | Used to record asset acquisitions or retirements (disposals). These orders initiate the purchase or sale of fixed assets and manage related operational details.            |
| **Asset Transactions**        | Records value changes of assets such as capitalization, revaluation, impairment, or transfers between valuation models. Can also include opening balance entries.           |
| **Depreciation Plans**        | Defines the planned depreciation schedule for assets within a specified period or valuation model. Each plan can generate multiple depreciation documents.                  |
| **Depreciations**             | Performs the actual depreciation calculation and posting for a financial period based on the rules defined in the selected **Depreciation Method** and **Valuation Model**. |

### Definitions

| Definition       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Assets** | The master records representing individual tangible assets. Each record includes its category, valuation model, currency, purchase and deployment dates, and current status. |
| **Asset Groups** | Logical groupings of assets defined by the user for reporting, management, or internal classification purposes.                                                              |

| **Asset Categories**                                                                                                  | Classifies assets by type (e.g., Motor Vehicles, Computers, Software, Machinery) and associates each category with the appropriate product type.                                                                         |
| **[Depreciation Methods](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/financials/fixed-assets/depreciation-methods/index.html)** | Defines the calculation logic for asset depreciation. Can be **system-defined** (e.g., Straight Line, User Defined with Table) or **user-defined**, and specifies period and function parameters.                        |
| **Valuation Models**                                                                                                  | Represents the frameworks for asset valuation, such as **Accounting** or **Taxation**. Each asset may maintain multiple valuations simultaneously, with depreciation and transactions linked to the corresponding model. |
