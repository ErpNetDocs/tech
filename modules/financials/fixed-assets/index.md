# Fixed assets

The Fixed Assets submodule is responsible for managing **the full lifecycle of an enterprise's long-term tangible assets** â€” from acquisition and valuation to depreciation and retirement. It ensures compliance with accounting and tax regulations by maintaining separate valuation models and automating the periodic calculation of depreciation.

## Structure

Fixed Assets supports key documents used to record asset events and periodic operations required for financial accounting.

### Documents and Operations

| **Acquire and Retire Orders** | Documents used to initiate or record the purchase or disposal (sale/retirement) of a fixed asset. |
| **Asset Transactions** | Used to record basic asset value transactions and opening balances related to fixed assets. |
| **Depreciation Plans** | The planning document that allows users to create and define the anticipated depreciation schedules for a specific period or set of assets. |
| **Depreciations** | The periodic operation document that records the actual calculation and booking of asset wear and tear for a financial period. It is typically generated based on the chosen **Valuation Model**. |
