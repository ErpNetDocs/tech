# Excise Stamp Operations

An Excise Stamp is a government-issued security document that certifies the payment of the required excise duty for goods released for consumption. It is a paper strip with permanent markings. Only licensed manufacturers and traders—importers with special permits—are entitled to purchase Excise Stamps.

The Excise Stamps Operation documents are intended to organize the accountability when working with Excise Stamps for the registered trader. With its help, all operations required by the authorities can be tracked, such as receiving, affixing to products, discarding, transferring to another tax warehouse, returning, and more.

Key elements:

1. **Document Data**: This includes the document type, document number, document date, the trader’s company, and other fields that are typically completed in documents.
2. **Tax Warehouse**: The tax warehouse where the Excise Stamps are provided to release the excise goods for consumption.
3. **Excise Stamp Operation Type**: These are the operations for which records are kept for the authorities. The nomenclature is provided by the relevant state authorities. Examples include Receiving from the authorities, Affixing, Returning, and others.
4. **Excise Product Type for which the Excise Stamps are Tracked**: This is a definition related to the excise characteristics of the products that are defined.
5. **Excise Stamp Lot**: This refers to the series of Excise Stamps provided in a package and includes relevant attributes—Quantity, Starting Number, Ending Number, and Description. The description can define other characteristic attributes, if any—Year, Series, and others.
6. **Product**: The product is not a mandatory attribute, but it is necessary if Excise Stamp Operations are generated from other documents in the system.

There are several checks when entering Excise Stamp operations that facilitate the process and minimize errors. Excise Stamp operations can be integrated into overall workflows, generated from a inventory transaction. For some operations, such as Affixing, they can be created automatically for the respective quantities, requiring only the lots and starting number to be filled in.
