# Overview

According to EU legislation, certain products need to be taxed additionally when they are imported into a given warehouse. This one-time **excise tax** is due as soon as the product itself is manufactured, and is universal for **all excise products**.

The **Excise** module is designed to assist enterprises in meeting their legal duties to regional custom agencies or other institutions requiring excise taxes. Using the available templates, you can create and generate various documents and definitions related to the excise payment.

> [!NOTE]
> Excise can currently be used **only** in Bulgaria and features only alcoholic drinks as excise-taxable products.

## Process flow

In order to use this module, you need to define your own digital **tax warehouse**. Its purpose is to store all of your manufactured or bought excise products, and provide regular reports to the tax-collecting agency regarding their movements.

For instance, depending on how a product enters or leaves the warehouse, a particular **document** needs to be created to reflect the excise tax imposed for this operation. It will be used by the customs agency (or regional equivalent) and includes the respective incoming or outgoing **transaction** associated with the excise products.

> [!NOTE]
> Tax warehouses are not tied to one physical location. It's possible to add products from **multiple** warehouses into a single tax warehouse as long as they originate from the same city.

Depending on the requirements of your regional agency, in addition to regular reports, all existing documents need to be included and sent into a **final declaration**. 

Once products are sold or simply leave the tax warehouse meeting all legal requirements, their excise tax is settled and they're **no longer** classified as excise products.
