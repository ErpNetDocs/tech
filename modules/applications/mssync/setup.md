# Setup

Within this section, you can find data about your **enterprise company** - the one logged in MsSync, which includes details like **location** and **time zone**. 

This section also showcases the **state** of the app, as visible in **[Home](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/applications/mssync/home.html)**.

Below, there's a **slider button** for toggling synchronization for a given job on and off.

## Sync jobs 

As in **[Home](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/applications/mssync/home.html)**, thereâ€™s a panel presenting available **sync jobs**.

### Activate and deactivate synchronization 

This button **enables** or **disables** the sync job assigned to it. Simply toggle the slider button in the respective direction and the process will commence. 

On first-time activation, the system will sync data for the **past two weeks and the upcoming year**. 

Afterwards, synchronization will occur **every 15 minutes**.
