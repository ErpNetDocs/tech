# Setup

Within this section, you can find data about your **enterprise company** - the one logged in MsSync, which includes details like **location** and **time zone**. 

This section also showcases the **state** of the app, as visible in **[Home](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/applications/mssync/home.html)**.

Below, there's a **slider button** for toggling synchronization for a given job on and off.

## Sync Jobs 

As in **[Home](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/applications/mssync/home.html)** section, hereâ€™s a panel presenting available **Sync Jobs**. 

Here, alongside the **UTC (Latest sync)**, you'll notice two extra actions: one for ***Sync Jobs** activation and deactivation, and another for refreshing the module.

### Activate and deactivate Sync button

The function of this button is to initiate the **Sync Job** assigned to it. Simply toggle the sliding button, and the process will commence. 

Upon activation, the software will sync data for the preceding two weeks and the upcoming year. Afterwards, synchronization will occur every fifteen minutes.
