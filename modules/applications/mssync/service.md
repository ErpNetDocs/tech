# Service 

The **Service** section is exclusively designed for **ERP.net** admins. 

Here, admins can request permission for **Office365** resources from an admin within the **Enterprise Company**. 

This permission is essential for enabling synchronization between the company's **Office365** and **ERP**. 

Once granted, seamless interaction and synchronization processes can commence.

This permission not only enables modifications to existing resources but also allows the addition of new ones. 

Any changes made to resources in the **ERP** are mirrored in the **Office365**, and the other way around.
