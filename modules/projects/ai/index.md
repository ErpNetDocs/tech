# AI

## Overview

The **AI system in @@name** introduces intelligent automation and natural language capabilities directly within the ERP platform.  
It enables users to interact with **AI Assistants**, **AI Chat Arbiters**, and **AI-powered business logic**, seamlessly integrated into daily workflows.

ERP.net’s AI functionality is built on an **external provider model**, currently supporting **OpenAI’s models** (such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o).  
This means ERP.net connects securely to OpenAI’s API to generate, process, and analyze natural language, but the architecture is **extensible** — designed to accommodate other AI providers in the future.

By embedding this technology throughout ERP.net, users can:

- Chat with an **AI Assistant** directly inside the application.  
- Involve AI as a **Chat Arbiter** in group or private conversations.  
- Use AI in **form panels** to analyze, explain, or generate business data.  
- Automate and validate operations through **AI-enhanced business rules**.  
- Employ AI-powered tools such as **document ingestion**, **lead creation**, and **intelligent task generation**.

The goal is to make AI a **natural and context-aware part of everyday ERP processes**, improving accuracy, speed, and decision-making across all departments.
