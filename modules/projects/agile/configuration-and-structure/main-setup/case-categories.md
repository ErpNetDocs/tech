## Case Categories

Once Project Types have been defined, the next essential step in setting up Agile PM is to define the Case Categories — a required element before any Cases can be created.  
Case Category is a classification unit that groups Cases with a similar purpose, structure, or role within the workflow. It is used for:

- Organizing and classifying individual Cases  
- Reflecting the internal workflow logic of the organization

Typical examples include bugs, features, enhancements, user stories, scheduled tasks, feedback, internal discussions, etc.

The detailed setup of Case Categories is organized into two sections:

- **Main Settings** – define allowed project types and parent relationships.
- **Advanced Settings** – control additional behavior such as mandatory parents, visibility of system states, and default description templates.
