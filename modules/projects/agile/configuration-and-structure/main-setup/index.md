## Main setup

To enable users to work effectively in Agile PM, several structural elements must be defined in advance. These include:

- **Project Types** – required for creating Projects
- **Case Categories** – required for creating Cases
- **User States** – optional but highly recommended for customizing Case workflows

Each of these components supports the internal logic of the organization and ensures consistency across project execution.  
They should be configured according to the organization’s internal classification, workflow processes, and project practices.
