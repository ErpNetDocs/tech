## Project Types

Projects in **Agile PM** are specific initiatives that always belong to a **Project Type**.  
**Project Types are required for creating Projects in Agile PM.**

Each Project Type represents a general category of projects that share common goals, structure, or internal classification.

**For example:** 
A marketing agency may frequently work on websites or digital campaigns. In this case, "Website Development" or "Social Media Strategy" could be defined as Project Types.

> [!Note]
> A Project Type is not:
> - a business division  
> - a specific product or service  
> - a particular project  
> 
> Instead, it is a high-level classification of project nature based on the organizationâ€™s internal taxonomy.
