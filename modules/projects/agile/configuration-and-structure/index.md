## Configuration and structure

This section provides an overview of the foundational elements required to configure Agile PM successfully:

- [Main Setup](../configuration-and-structure/main-setup/index.md) – defines core components such as Project Types, Case Categories, and User States that support classification and workflow consistency.
- [Definitions](../configuration-and-structure/project-definitions/index.md) – introduces the structures used to execute and manage actual work, including Projects, Areas, and Milestones.
