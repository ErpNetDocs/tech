## Project Areas

A **Project Area** in @@name represents a distinct structural unit within a Project, typically focused on a specific part of the overall work.  
It is used to divide a Project into smaller, more manageable components that can be handled independently, either by different teams or based on specialized responsibilities.

Each Project can consist of one or more Project Areas, depending on its complexity and structure.

**For example**:
A project of type **Client Implementation** may include Project Areas such as **Data Migration**, **System Configuration**, and **User Training**, each handled by specialized teams.

> [!Note]
> While each Project Area typically belongs to a specific Project, it is also possible to define shared Project Areas that span across all Projects.  
> To do this, leave the *Project* field empty.
