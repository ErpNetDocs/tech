## Projects

A **Project** in @name represents a business initiative with a defined goal â€“ such as delivering a product, providing a service, or executing an internal improvement.  
Projects can be client-facing or internal, and they structure the work, timeline, people, and deliverables related to the initiative.

A Project can only be created if **Project Types** have already been defined.  
Each Project belongs to exactly one Project Type.

> [!Note]
> The layout of the Project form may vary depending on the selected Project Type.  
> This allows each Project to display only the fields and panels relevant to its type.  
>  
*For examples of real-world Projects and their types, see Project Types.
