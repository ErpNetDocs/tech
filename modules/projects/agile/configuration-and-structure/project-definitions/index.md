## Project definitions

Once the core structural elements of Agile PM have been configured — such as Project Types, Case Categories, and User States — the next step is to define the specific project-level structures that will be used in practice.

These include:

- **Projects** – representing actual business initiatives (see 2.1)  
- **Project Areas** – optional subdivisions used to organize work within a Project (see 2.2)  
- **Project Milestones** – optional checkpoints used to track significant events and goals (see 2.3)

These elements provide the operational framework within which work is planned, executed, and monitored.  
They are built on top of the foundational setup from section 1 and are essential for the day-to-day functioning of the Agile PM module.
