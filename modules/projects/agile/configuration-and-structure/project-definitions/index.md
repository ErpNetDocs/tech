## Definitions

Once the core structural elements of Agile PM have been configured — such as [Project Types](../main-setup/project-types.md), [Case Categories](../main-setup/case-categories.md), and [User States](../main-setup/user-states.md) — the next step is to define the specific project-level structures that will be used in practice.

These include:

- [Projects](projects.md) – representing actual business initiatives
- [Project Areas](project-areas.md) – optional subdivisions used to organize work within a Project or across multiple Projects.
- [Project Milestones](project-milestones.md) – optional checkpoints representing key events and goals within a Project or shared across multiple Projects.

These elements provide the operational framework within which work is planned, executed, and monitored.  
They are built on top of the foundational setup from section 1 and are essential for the day-to-day functioning of the Agile PM module.
