## Definitions

Once the core structural elements of Agile PM have been configured — such as [Project Types](../main-setup/project-types.md), [Case Categories](../main-setup/case-categories.md), and [User States](../main-setup/user-states.md) — the next step is to define the specific project-level structures that will be used in practice.

These include:

- [Projects](projects.md) – business initiatives serving as containers for agile work.
- [Project Groups](project-groups.md) – logical groupings of projects that share common configurations such as areas and milestones. 
- [Project Areas](project-areas.md) – subdivisions used to organize work within a Project, across a Project Group, or globally across all Projects and Project Groups.
- [Project Milestones](project-milestones.md) – checkpoints representing key events and goals within a Project, within a Project Group, or globally across all Projects and Project Groups.
- [Sprints](sprints.md) – fixed timeboxes (typically 1–4 weeks) used to plan and track the execution of cases toward a defined sprint goal.

These elements provide the operational framework within which work is planned, executed, and monitored.  
They are built on top of the foundational setup from section 1 and are essential for the day-to-day functioning of the Agile PM module.
