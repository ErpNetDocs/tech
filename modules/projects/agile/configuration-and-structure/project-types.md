### Project Types

Projects in Agile PM are specific initiatives that always belong to a Project Type.  
**Project Types are required for creating Projects in Agile PM.**

Each Project Type represents a general category of projects that share common goals, structure, or internal classification.

For example, a marketing agency may frequently work on websites or digital campaigns. In this case, “Website Development” or “Social Media Strategy” could be defined as Project Types.

> **Note:**  
> A Project Type is not:
> 
> - a business division  
> - a specific product or service  
> - a particular project  
> 
> Instead, it is a high-level classification of project nature based on the organization’s internal taxonomy.
