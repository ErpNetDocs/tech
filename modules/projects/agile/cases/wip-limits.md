## WIP (work-in-progress) limits

**Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits** are a key control mechanism in the **Agile PM** module that helps prevent excessive accumulation of active tasks in specific workflow stages.  
They support balanced task distribution, reduce bottlenecks, and maintain a steady pace of execution.


### WIP limit enforcement

WIP limits are automatically enforced during Case state transitions â€” specifically when a user attempts to move a Case into one of the following **System States**:

- **Consider**
- **Ready**
- **In Progress**

If a WIP limit is exceeded, the system will block the transition and display a clear message to the user.


### WIP limit evaluation logic

The logic for determining whether a WIP limit is exceeded is as follows:

- **If no Project Area is assigned to the Case, or the assigned Project Area has no WIP limit for the target state:**  
  The system checks if the Case's **Project** has a limit for that state.  
  It then counts all Cases in the same Project that are currently in the target System State.  
  If the count **exceeds** the defined limit, the transition is blocked.

- **If the Case has a Project Area with a WIP limit for the target state:**  
  The system counts only the Cases that belong to the **same Project Area** and are linked to the **same Project** as the Case's Project.  
  If this count **exceeds** the defined limit, the transition is blocked.
