# Price types

**Price types** are used to set additional priority conditions for the prices. 

5 is the highest priority level that can be selected in the Priority field of the price. To add an additional higher priority, a price type must be defined and selected as a price type of the price. Priorities among the different price types are set by filling a number in the Ordinal position field in the definition of the price type â€“ the lower the number, the higher the priority.


**Price types add additional priority under the following algorithm:**

If a price has a defined price type, this price will be with the highest priority among other prices - no matter their level of priority. 

If more than one price has a defined price type, the price with the price type that has the lowest ordinal position will be with the highest priority.

If more than one price has a defined price type and their price types have equal ordinal positions, the price with the highest priority will be selected.
