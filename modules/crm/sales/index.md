# Sales

The **Sales** module plays a pivotal role in documenting sales operations within **ERP.net**. It is through here that you can **preview**, **create** and **release** different kinds of sales orders.

Consisting of one panel, **Sales** consolidates essential functionalities for creating and managing sales orders and their related entities. 

It also makes use of previously specified sales order **[definitions](definitions/index.md)** that are necessary for the creation of the respective documents.

## Orders panel

This panel serves as the central hub of the **Sales** module, allowing you to **access** all of your existing sales orders as well as instantly begin **creating** new ones.

It consists of three main sections: **Create**, **Sub Entities**, and **Related Entities**.
