# Orders

The Orders page is home to all orders linked to a customer.

It is visible to all Client Center users accessing this customers's data with an **[external role](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/crm/sales/customers/external-access.html#roles)** **L20 - Orders** and above.

### Details

You can find the following information about each order in the table:

- **Date** - Date of submission (or registration) of the document.
- **Type name** - Type of the document, e.g. Sales Order.
- **Document No** - The document number.
- **Amount** - The amount of the order. 
- **Status** - Current state of the order (e.g. New, Ordered, Cancelled).

> [!Important]
>
> Pricing data like **Amount** is visible ONLY to users with an external role **L30 - Orders with Prices** and above.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Orders that are started but not placed are automatically saved and registered with status **New**.

### Document types

By default, the Orders page displays all order documents of all document types.

Administrators can optionally configure it to display only orders of a certain type. 

If set, the **[OrderDocumentTypes JSON setting](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/crm/clientcenter/reference.html#orderdocumenttypes-setting)** determines which order document type or types can be shown.

## Order document 

If you click the **blue arrow button** on the leftmost portion of a row, you can open an order document.

Inside, you can find customer and enterprise company data, as well as individual lines breakdown.

2. If present, files attached to an order will be displayed in a dedicated section, along with their name, extension and size.

    **Clicking once** on a file's name will trigger its download.

   File attachments whose **[Access Permission](https://docs.erp.net/webclient/introduction/how-to/access-permission-field.html)** field is not set to **"Internal users + external users"** will not appear in the **Files** section.

    If none of the orderâ€™s attachments have this setting configured, the **Files** section will not appear at all.
