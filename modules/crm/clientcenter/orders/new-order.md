# Create a new order

Order creation through the Client Center is disabled by default. You need to enable the respective global JSON settings first.

Once that's done, users with **[external role](/modules/crm/sales/customers/external-access.md)** **L20 - Orders** and above will get access to the **New Order** screen.

This is a multi-tab panel dedicated to the filling out and placement of new sales orders.
