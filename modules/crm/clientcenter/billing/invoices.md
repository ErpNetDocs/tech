If present, files attached to an invoice will be displayed in a dedicated section, along with their name, extension and size.

**Clicking once** on a file's name will trigger its download.

File attachments whose **[Access Permission](https://docs.erp.net/webclient/introduction/how-to/access-permission-field.html)** field is not set to **"Internal users + external users"** will not appear in the **Files** section.

If none of the invoiceâ€™s attachments have this setting configured, the **Files** section will not appear at all.
