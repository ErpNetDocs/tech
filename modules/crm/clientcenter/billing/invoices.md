### Details

You can find the following information about each invoice in the table:

- **Document No** - The document number.
- **Last download** - The last time the document was downloaded.
- **Type name** - Type of the document, Invoice by default.
- **Date** - Date of creation of the document.
- **Amount** - The amount of the invoice.

### Document types

By default, the **Invoices** page displays all invoices of all document types.

Administrators can optionally configure it to display only invoices of a certain type. 

If set, the **[InvoiceDocumentTypes JSON setting](https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/crm/clientcenter/reference.html#invoicedocumenttypes-setting)** determines which invoice document type or types can be shown.

## Invoice document

If you click the **blue arrow button** on the leftmost portion of a row, you can reveal more details about an invoice.

If present, files attached to an invoice will be displayed in a dedicated section, along with their name, extension and size.

**Clicking once** on a file's name will trigger its download.
