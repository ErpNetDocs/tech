# How to create a new order

To create an order in the **Client Center**, you need to have this feature enabled manually.

See **[this guide](apply-platform-settings.md)** if you haven't already done that.

When you have access to the New Order functionality, you need to obtain all the necessary **product codes** to complete your order.

## Step-by-step process

1. Click on the **New Order** button in the **Client Center** menu.
