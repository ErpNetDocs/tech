# How to download attached files from an invoice

This article provides a step-by-step guide on downloading attached files from an invoice through the Client Center.

### Prerequisites

To be able to view and download file attachments from an invoice in the Client Center, you must configure its **Access Permissions** field through your ERP.net platform instance.

Simply navigate to the respective invoice, expand the **Files** panel, open its **Details** and set the value of the **Access Permissions** field to **Internal users + external users**.

## Step-by-step process

1.	Navigate to the **Invoices** portion of the **Client Center** menu.
