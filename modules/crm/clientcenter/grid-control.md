# Grid control 

The **Grid control** is a component used for displaying, organizing, and manipulating tabular data across its modules. 

It provides functionalities like sorting, filtering, and summarizing data, enhancing user interaction with large datasets.

## Total summary

**Total summary** is a feature that automatically displays the count for document numbers and the sum for remaining amounts across all pages, providing a comprehensive data overview without the need for activation.

## Advanced Filtering and Search

With the addition of a **Column filter** and **Search field**, you can filter and search through large datasets.

### Column filter

In the column filter, you can specify the information to be displayed in a particular column. 

For instance, you can filter a date column to show only a specific year or month, or filter a column to display only entries with a certain name or amount.

### Search field

In the Search Bar, you can filter the entire table by entering a word, letter, or number, and it will display only the items containing the specified input in any of their columns.

## Grouping and Summarization

The grid control supports data grouping with **Group footer summary**, allowing users to organize data hierarchically and see summary information for each group, including counts and sums.

By dragging and dropping a column header into the **”Drag a column header here to group by that column”** row, you can group the data by that column.

To group by multiple columns, simply drag additional column headers next to the first one. 

The data will be grouped first by the initial column, followed by the subsequent columns.

## Column chooser

The **Column Chooser** feature allows you to decide which columns to display in the table. 
To access it, click on the blue icon at the top right of the column.

To select columns for display, simply check the ones you want to show and leave unchecked the ones you want to hide.
