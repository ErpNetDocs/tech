# CRM Contacts and tasks

The Contacts and tasks module is used to manage parties and calendars.

When used as part of the sales process, they can initiate the sales process flow:

> **Activity** → *Opportunity* → *Offer* → *Sales order* → *Invoice order* → *Invoice*

## Activities

The activities are like calendar appointments on steroids. Activities

* Have related party reference, allowing to sort activities by party.
* Allow attachments of files.
* Support questionaries (through the use of user defined data attributes)
And much more.

Activities can be used to automatically create sales opportunities in the [Presales](../presales/index.md) module.
