# CRM Presales

The presales module is used to manage the presales process.
The main document is called @Crm.Presales.Deals and is used to manage the opportunities.

Each deal represents a sales opportunity to new or existing customer.
The opportunities:

* Have appointed sales representative, managing the deal.
* Do not have line items. They are used to manage deals, wbich are still not clear enough to detail at this level.
* Have a percentage probability of success. The percentage is set by the sales representative, based on their own judgement.
* Have expected sales revenue.
* Have expected close date.

Based on the data above, the team leaders and sales managers have instant and clear visibility over the sales processes.

The deals documents can be easily transformed in Offers (quotes), which contain detailed line items.

The deals are usually initially created based on activities.
However, once a deal is created, it can be used to create many more sub-activities to manage related tasks.
