# CRM Overview

CRM in @@name organizes the work with potential and existing customers through clearly defined records and documents — Leads, Contacts, Opportunities, Offers, and Orders.  
The system guides users from the first interaction with a potential contact to a completed sale and subsequent invoicing.

CRM in @@name manages the entire commercial process around sales. It is designed to structure sales work through clearly defined records, roles, and responsibilities, making the process intuitive for sales teams and reliable from a data and reporting perspective.

As sales teams grow, the need for structure, ownership, and visibility becomes critical. That is why @@name treats the Sales Representative (Sales Person) as a core element of the CRM process — Leads and Opportunities are owned by sales people, ensuring accountability and clear responsibility for every deal.

At the same time, CRM in @@name allows you to start with minimal information, add structure only when it becomes logically necessary, and manage deals in a way that remains traceable, controllable, and scalable as the organization and workload expand.

## How @@name views the CRM process

The **Lead to Cash** process is an established best practice in many CRM systems and describes the path from the first contact to actual revenue realization. @@name builds on these best practices and implements the process in an elegant and practical way, clearly separating the different stages and record types.

The main CRM flow in @@name looks as follows:

---

Lead → (qualification / identification) → Party (Person / Company) → Opportunity → Offer → Sales Order → Invoice

---

## Lead

A **Lead** is a record representing a potential contact. It can store as much information as needed, but it is designed to be created quickly, without enforcing a large number of mandatory fields.

The purpose of the Lead is to capture interest in the system with minimal friction, while still allowing additional details, classifications, and custom fields to be added whenever they are available or relevant.

---

## Party (Person / Company)

A **Party** is a structured business entity – a registered company or individual for which minimal but required attributes must be provided. These are the data points the system expects in order for the process to continue – deals, offers, orders, and invoices.

@@name requires a Party to be identified before an **Opportunity** can be created. This is not a limitation, but a guarantee that every real deal has a solid data foundation – a system record from which the entire process can continue consistently.

---

## Opportunity

An **Opportunity** represents a potential deal – a business opportunity that is always linked to a specific Party. Multiple Opportunities may exist for a single Party (Person / Company).

An Opportunity reflects a specific expressed interest and a concrete possibility for a deal. From a single Opportunity, multiple offers can be created, which is one of the practical advantages of the system – it provides traceability of how many proposals were made before reaching a **Sales Order**.

Each Opportunity is assigned to a **leading Sales Person**, ensuring clear ownership, accountability, and visibility over who is responsible for advancing the deal through the sales process.

---

### Activities

Activities represent the actual sales work performed by sales representatives — meetings, calls, visits, demos, and other interactions with potential contacts and customers.

In @@name, Activities are closely linked to Opportunities and form the bridge between sales effort and sales results. Sales representatives use Activities to plan and report their work, while managers gain visibility into how deals progress as a result of real actions.

The relationship between Activities and Opportunities reflects real-world sales processes:

- a single Activity may lead to multiple Opportunities;
- a single Opportunity may involve multiple Activities over time.

By combining Activities with Opportunities, @@name provides a complete picture of both sales performance and sales effort.

### Lead to Order and Lead to Cash — what is the difference

In CRM documentation, the terms **Lead to Order** and **Lead to Cash** are often used.

**Lead to Order** covers the commercial part of the process — from the first contact to a confirmed sale. It includes:

- qualifying interest (Lead),
- identifying the business partner (Party),
- managing the deal (Opportunity),
- preparing proposals (Offer),
- confirming the agreement (Sales Order).

**Lead to Cash** extends this process to include invoicing and revenue realization:

- preparation for invoicing (Invoice Order),
- issuing invoices,
- tracking payments, depending on configuration and used modules.

If **Lead to Order** answers the question  
*“Have we closed the deal?”*,  
**Lead to Cash** answers  
*“Have we completed it financially?”*.

---

### Lead to Cash

**Lead to Cash** covers the entire process. It includes the steps already described in Lead to Order and continues with the invoicing of the deal.

The process includes:

- preparation for invoicing (Invoice Order),
- issuing an invoice (Invoice),
- tracking due payments (depending on the modules and settings used).

In other words, if **Lead to Order** answers the question  
*“Have we closed the deal?”*,  
then **Lead to Cash** answers  
*“Have we completed it financially?”*.

## What follows from the logic of the CRM process

This model has direct practical implications:

- the system controls the creation of Opportunities and requires the necessary company data (Party) that will be needed later in the process;
- the process guides the user and does not allow skipping key stages;
- each subsequent step has the required information available;
- sales activities become structured, visible, and traceable, making it clear which sales person is working on what and how deals progress;
- the process remains clear for sales users, administrators, and management alike.

This makes CRM in @@name predictable, learnable, and sustainable over time.

## Getting started with CRM in @@name

If you are setting up the CRM module for the first time, it is recommended to start simple and follow the natural flow of the sales process.

Begin by exploring the **Presales** functionality to understand how Leads, Parties, and Opportunities work together and how interest is gradually converted into real sales potential. This provides a clear picture of the core CRM logic without requiring complex configuration upfront.

The next logical step is **Sales**, where this potential is turned into confirmed orders and the Lead-to-Order process is completed.

Once the core flow is in place, you can extend the process step by step with additional capabilities such as **Marketing**, **Sales Force rules**, **Subscriptions**, **POS**, or **Client Center**, depending on your business needs.
