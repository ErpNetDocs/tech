# CRM Overview

CRM in @@name organizes the work with potential and existing customers through clearly defined records and documents – **Leads, Contacts, Opportunities, Offers, and Orders**.  
The system guides the user step by step – from the first contact, through a potential deal, to a completed sale.

CRM in @@name manages the entire sales process – from the initial signal of interest to order creation and invoicing. It is designed to structure sales activities through clearly defined records, roles, and steps, making the process easy to use for sales teams and reliable from a data integrity perspective.

In practice, CRM becomes essential when sales teams start to grow. That is why @@name treats the **Sales Representative (Sales Person)** as a core part of the CRM process — Leads can be assigned to a sales person, and every Opportunity has a leading sales representative responsible for driving the deal forward.

CRM in @@name allows you to start with minimal information, add structure only when it becomes necessary, and manage deals in a way that is traceable, accountable, and sustainable as teams and workload grow.

## How @@name views the CRM process

The **Lead to Cash** process is an established best practice in many CRM systems and describes the path from the first contact to actual revenue realization. @@name builds on these best practices and implements the process in an elegant and practical way, clearly separating the different stages and record types.

The main CRM flow in @@name looks as follows:

---

Lead → (qualification / identification) → Party (Person / Company) → Opportunity → Offer → Sales Order → Invoice

---

## Lead

A **Lead** is a record representing a potential contact. It can store as much information as needed, but it is designed to be created quickly, without enforcing a large number of mandatory fields.

The purpose of the Lead is to capture interest in the system with minimal friction, while still allowing additional details, classifications, and custom fields to be added whenever they are available or relevant.


---

## Party (Person / Company)

A **Party** is a structured business entity – a registered company or individual for which minimal but required attributes must be provided. These are the data points the system expects in order for the process to continue – deals, offers, orders, and invoices.

@@name requires a Party to be identified before an **Opportunity** can be created. This is not a limitation, but a guarantee that every real deal has a solid data foundation – a system record from which the entire process can continue consistently.

---

## Opportunity

An **Opportunity** represents a potential deal – a business opportunity that is always linked to a specific Party. Multiple Opportunities may exist for a single Party (Person / Company).

An Opportunity reflects a specific expressed interest and a concrete possibility for a deal. From a single Opportunity, multiple offers can be created, which is one of the practical advantages of the system – it provides traceability of how many proposals were made before reaching a **Sales Order**.

Each Opportunity is assigned to a **leading Sales Person**, ensuring clear ownership, accountability, and visibility over who is responsible for advancing the deal through the sales process.

## Lead to Order and Lead to Cash – what is the difference

In CRM documentation, two terms are commonly used: **Lead to Order** and **Lead to Cash**.  
In @@name, they have a clear and practical meaning.

### Lead to Order

**Lead to Order** covers the CRM part of the process — the path from the first contact to a confirmed sale.  
The focus here is on:

- collecting and qualifying potential customers (Lead),
- creating records for real business partners (Party),
- managing the sales opportunity (Opportunity),
- preparing a proposal (Offer),
- reaching a confirmed order (Sales Order).

This is the stage where the sale is agreed and under control.

---

### Lead to Cash

**Lead to Cash** covers the entire process. It includes the steps already described in Lead to Order and continues with the invoicing of the deal.

The process includes:

- preparation for invoicing (Invoice Order),
- issuing an invoice (Invoice),
- tracking due payments (depending on the modules and settings used).

In other words, if **Lead to Order** answers the question  
*“Have we closed the deal?”*,  
then **Lead to Cash** answers  
*“Have we completed it financially?”*.

## What follows from the logic of the CRM process

This model has direct practical implications:

- the system controls the creation of Opportunities and requires the necessary company data (Party) that will be needed later in the process;
- the process guides the user and does not allow skipping key stages;
- each subsequent step has the required information available;
- sales activities become structured, visible, and traceable, making it clear which sales person is working on what and how deals progress;
- the process remains clear for sales users, administrators, and management alike.

This makes CRM in @@name predictable, learnable, and sustainable over time.

The CRM documentation is organized to guide you gradually from the big picture to the details:

- **[Presales](./presales/index.md)** – working with Leads, Opportunities, and Offers
- **[Sales](./sales/index.md)** – how offers are converted into orders
- **[Pricing](./pricing/index.md)** – defining prices, discounts, and rules
- **[Invoicing](./invoicing/index.md)** – controlling the invoicing process, including Invoice Orders and issued invoices
- **[Marketing](./marketing/index.md)** – planning and executing marketing campaigns and managing distribution channels
- **[Sales Force](./sales-force/index.md)** – managing sales personnel, group structures, task assignment rules, and targets
- **[Subscriptions](./subscriptions/index.md)** – agreements for recurring services and periodic invoicing
- **[POS](./pos/index.md)** – managing point-of-sale operations in physical retail locations
- **[Client Center](./clientcenter/index.md)** – configuring a platform for customer engagement and self-service

## Getting started with CRM in @@name

If you are setting up the CRM module for the first time, it is recommended to start simple and follow the natural flow of the sales process.

Begin by exploring the **Presales** functionality to understand how Leads, Parties, and Opportunities work together and how interest is gradually converted into real sales potential. This provides a clear picture of the core CRM logic without requiring complex configuration upfront.

The next logical step is **Sales**, where this potential is turned into confirmed orders and the Lead-to-Order process is completed.

Once the core flow is in place, you can extend the process step by step with additional capabilities such as **Marketing**, **Sales Force rules**, **Subscriptions**, **POS**, or **Client Center**, depending on your business needs.
