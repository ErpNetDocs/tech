# Product Relations

The Product Relations framework provides a unified and extensible way to **define and manage how products are connected within the system** â€” whether functionally, commercially, or technically. 

Its purpose is to establish a single, consistent model for representing different types of product-to-product relationships, such as replacements, compatibility, merchandising links, or generic associations.
By standardizing these relations, the model enables automation of key business processes (e.g., one-click replacements, cross-sell suggestions, configuration validation), improves data consistency across modules, and simplifies future scalability.

Ultimately, Product Relations aim to create a flexible foundation that supports better product lifecycle management, smarter system behavior, and richer customer experiences across all product-driven operations.
