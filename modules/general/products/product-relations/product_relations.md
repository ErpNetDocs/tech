# Product Relations 

System Product Relation Types define how the system interprets and handles a relation.
Custom Product Relation Types define what that relation means in your business.

Creating your own relation types gives you better control and clarity over product relationships, freedom to reflect your business terminology and logic and the ability to scale and extend product data without development effort.
