# Products


*Products* are goods which are the object of a company’s business activities. Products can be tangible or intangible. A tangible product is a physical object that can be perceived by touch such as a building, vehicle, gadget, or clothing. An intangible product is a product that can only be perceived indirectly such as services. 

In @name all product-specific data is kept in the product’s definition. 

Product’s definition includes the information required for specific business processes and other basic data that describes and categorizes the product, for example: 

- product name; 
- part number; 
- product type; 
- measurement unit; 
- costing currency and others. 

Different panels can also be visualized in the product’s definition, allowing the user to have access to all of the product related information such as **[Product Dimensions](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/general/products/product-dimensions/index.md)**, current stock holds, serial numbers, lots, product prices and others.  

All products are grouped in user defined product groups (e.g. goods, materials, services …) according to different criteria. For more information, see **[Product Groups](https://github.com/ErpNetDocs/tech/blob/master/modules/general/products/product-groups/index.md)**.
