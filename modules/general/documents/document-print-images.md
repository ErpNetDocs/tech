# Document print images 

Document print images contain the data of a printout of a document as it was obtained from the data source at the moment of printing. The data is used as a history in order to review the visual representation of the printed document.

The document print images would take the most space in customer databases. Therefore, it is good to delete obsolete records periodically. 

It is highly recommended that you set up a system job that will delete them automatically.
