# Foundation

The Foundation module provides the core set of configurable master data and structural definitions essential for the operation of the entire @@name system. Its primary function is to define the organizational structure, master units of measurement, geographical boundaries, and other basic reference data used universally across all modules. 

## Structure

This module contains fundamental definitions, serving as the common dictionary for the entire enterprise.
