# Favorites

You can build your own list of **favorites** by adding different items of interest. 

This includes the compaines, produts or any other entities that you follow. 

Once theyâ€™re marked as favorite, you will receive **notifications** for relevant events that happen to them.

If you mark a specific document as a favorite, it automatically includes **all** of its related documents.

This way, you can stay informed about important actions others may take on the documents.

### Add a favorite

To add a new item to your favorites, simply click on its **star button** at the top-right corner.

This could be any customer, document, campaign, lead, and much more.
