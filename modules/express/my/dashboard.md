# Dashboard

The Dashboard allows you to build a space in accordance with your preferences by adding, removing, or rearranging panels as needed. 

It's entirely **customizable**, giving you the freedom to prioritize what matters most to you, without any mandatory elements. 

It includes easy access to panels from sub-modules such as **Chat**, **Tiles**, **To Do** and **Calendar**, as well as many other items you can choose to additionally add into it.
