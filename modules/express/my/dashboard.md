# Dashboard

The Dashboard allows you to build a space in accordance with your preferences by adding, removing, or rearranging panels as needed. 

It's entirely **customizable**, giving you the freedom to prioritize what matters most to you, without any mandatory elements. 

It includes easy access to panels from sub-modules such as **[To Do](todo.md)** and **[Calendar](calendar.md)**, as well as many other items you can choose to add into it.

Different widgets allow you to perform a variety of actions on-demand.

Take advantage of them to [create tasks](todo.md), [schedule meetings](calendar.md), preview your [tiles](tiles.md), and much more!
