# Calendar

This is a personal environment which contains all individual events or tasks you've scheduled for yourself. 

Furthermore, it includes group activities from all the social groups you're participating in. 

Such events will appear in your calendar as long as you’re set as a responsible person, organizer, or participant in a group activity.

Within the Calendar, you can:

* **create** a new event
  
* change the **view** in which all events appear (Workweek, Month)

* **navigate** to past or future dates

* **access** any of your scheduled personal or group events.

### Time period

To change the view of the Calendar, use the **dropdown menu** on the right and select either "Month" or "Workweek". 

To get to specific weeks or months, use the **left** and **right** **arrows**.

Depending on the view, you can also select a specific **week** or **month** from the blue-colored navigator.
