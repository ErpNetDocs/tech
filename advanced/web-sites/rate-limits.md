# Rate limits

The rate limits in @@erpnet are a set of limits, related to the requests **per each session** that can be made within a specified period. Rate limiting is used to prevent overloading and ensure fair usage for all users (i.e. sessions).

Exceeding any type of limit will result in an HTTP response `429 - Too Many Requests`.

## Types

@@erpnet introduces several types rate limits, each targeting a specific use case. All are summarized in the following table and further described in more detail below:

| Rate limit | Config key | Default value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Requests per minute per session | `SessionRpm` | 600 |
| Concurrent requests per session | `SessionConcurrentRequests` | 1 |
| Concurrent transactions per session | `SessionConcurrentTransactions` | 1 |

### SessionRpm

A session requests per minute rate limit (RPM) is a type of rate limit that restricts the number of API requests made within a single session, measured in minutes. 

The default session RPM rate limit is set to 600, allowing for up to 600 requests to be made in a one-minute session. Exceeding the limit will result in an HTTP response `429 - Too Many Requests`.

### SessionConcurrentRequests

Session concurrent requests is a rate limit that restricts the number of concurrent API requests within a single session. The default limit is 1, allowing only one request at a time during a session. Exceeding the limit will result in an HTTP response `429 - Too Many Requests` until the previous request is completed.

### SessionConcurrentTransactions

Session concurrent transactions is a rate limit that restricts the number of concurrent API transactions within a session. The default behavior allows only one open transaction at a time during a session. Exceeding the limit will result in an HTTP response `429 - Too Many Requests` until the previous transaction is open.

## Configuring rate limits

The limits above are the default ones. You may specify others in the related web site definition.

The rate limits settings are expressed by a JSON object in a specific format. Here's what it looks like as part of a complete web site configuration:

```JSON
{
  "RateLimits": {
    "SessionRpm": 600,
    "SessionConcurrentRequests": 1,
    "SessionConcurrentTransactions": 1
  }
}
```
