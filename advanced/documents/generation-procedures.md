# Generation Procedures Overview


[!Generation Procedure](generation-procedure.svg)

Generation Procedures are automated procedures, which generate @Documents from other documents.
They are the basis for the @document-flow.
Generation Procedures are the arrows in the document flow diagrams.

## Setup

In order to start generating documents, the Generation Procedures need to be configured.
The configuration is performed in the Document Type entity, in the Document Type Routes child entity.

Each Document Type Route is a configuration for a single Generation Procedure.
