# Document Flow

### Description

The sequence of documents in a process forms the document flow. Actually, the documents in a process are more likely to be in a hierarchy; just a sequence of documents is a rare occurrence.

Documents in @@name often have sub-documents. Most of the time, the sub-documents are automatically generated (see **Document Generation**) or created by some fulfillment function (see **Order Fulfillment**).However,  manually entering a sub-document is also allowed and sometimes used.

Documents, their sub-documents, the sub-documents of the sub-documents, etc. form the sequence (or the hierarchy). The document flow design is one of the most important aspects of implementing @@name for a target enterprise.

The document flow is designed by designing the specific document routes for each Document Type.
