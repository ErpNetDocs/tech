# Data Objects Management

Data Objects are a design pattern, used to encapsulate logic, which is available to most data records in the system.

Each [aggregate](~/advanced/concepts/aggregates.md) root is a data object.
All data objects have some common attributes, sub-entities and operations.

The following data and operations can be associated with a data object:

* [Track changes](track-changes.md)
* [File Attachments]

For more detailed information, see [Extensible Data Objects](extensible-data-objects.md).
