## Compatible events chart

SENDMAIL is **not** compatible with all events. Take a look at the following chart:

| Event type                                                   | Compatibility with SENDMAIL                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Client commit (e.g. [CLIENTCOMMIT](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/user-business-rules/events/client-commit.html), [AGGREGATECLIENTCOMMIT](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/user-business-rules/events/aggregate-client-commit.html))     | compatible                                                   |
| Document events - (e.g. [STATECHANGING](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/user-business-rules/events/statechanging.html), [STATECHANGED](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/user-business-rules/events/statechanged.html), [VOIDING](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/user-business-rules/events/voiding.html))| compatible                                                   |
| Commit (e.g. [COMMIT](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/user-business-rules/events/commit.html))                                         | compatible but not recommended - if possible, use CLIENTCOMMIT instead |
| Front-end (e.g ATTRIBUTECHANGING, ATTRIBUTECHANGED)          | incompatible, the server won't send an email |

## Subject and body customization 

Text in the parameters for _Subject_ and _Body_ can be **customized**. For added convenience, there are a couple of implementations providing more formatting capabilities and facilitating the action as a whole.

- **escape charts** 

The following escape chars are handled:

`\n - newline - supported in the Body`

`\r\n - new line - supported in the Body`

`\{ - insert opening curly bracket '{' in output. - supported in both the Subject and the Body`

`\} - insert closing curly bracket '}' in output. - supported in both the Subject and the Body`

- **HTML tags** - supported in the Body

For text to be recognized as HTML, the Body has to contain the `</html>` tag. The position of the tag is irrelevant. If it's placed somewhere, the whole text is considered written in HTML.

- **Use of domain attributes in text** - supported in both the Subject and the Body

In the text of both parameters for Subject and Body, you can reach and use the domain attributes' values (system domain attributes and **[calculated attributes](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/calculated-attributes/index.html)**). They're calculated for the entity record for which the rule is executed. In order for a domain attribute to be property recognized by the system, it needs to be surrounded with curly brackets '{...}'.

The following options are supported:

1. Attributes: {DocumentDate}. <br>
2. References: {Customer}. <br>
3. Reference path: {Customer.Party.PartyName}. Note that child collections are not supported.

- **Domain attributes formatting** - supported in both the Subject and the Body

Domain attribute values can be formatted with standard .Net **[format specifiers](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/string-interpolation/format-specifiers.html)** and system-specific attributes.

### Example:

–ê business rule that sends an email with an order confirmation to the customer and the sales manager when a sales order has been released.
