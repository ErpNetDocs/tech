# FAIL

It's typically used to include additional validations in the system, which are currently not implemented. The FAIL syntax is simple - the current business rule will throw an error. Users are also able to set the error text as a constant. The constant may be entered as first parameter type and value.

**For example:** 

ActionNo: **1**; Action Type: **FAIL;** Parameter1 Type: **Constant**; Parameter1 Value: **'error message text'**.
