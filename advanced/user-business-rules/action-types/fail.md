# FAIL

It's mostly used to include additional validations in the system which **aren't** yet implemented. 

If FAIL is performed, the current business rule will throw an **error**. You can set the error text as a constant that's entered as a first parameter type and a value.

**Example:** 

Action No: **1**; <br>
Action type: **FAIL;** <br> 
Parameter1 type: **Constant**; <br> 
Parameter1 value: **'error message text'** <br>
