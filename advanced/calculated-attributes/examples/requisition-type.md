# RequisitionType of the Requisition linked to a Warehouse Order

This attribute extracts the direction (type) of the requisition document associated with a warehouse order. It resolves the requisition type by navigating through a line in the order and following its reference back to the parent requisition document.

The value returned corresponds to the **RequisitionType** field of the requisition (e.g. `Inbound`, `Outbound`, etc.).

> [!NOTE]  
> The repository of the attribute is *Logistics.Wms.WarehouseOrders*
