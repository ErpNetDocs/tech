# User calculated attributes

User calculated attributes are user-defined objects which extend the system entities.

They're defined like formulas.

<br> When the value of a calculated attribute is requested, it's calculated "on the fly", in **real-time**.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Calculated attribute formulas are compiled to native executable format.<br>
> Their calculation speed is very similar to the speed of the system-defined calculated attributes.

#### Example 1 - Get default payment term days

Suppose that in a sales order, you want to display the customers default payment term (in days).

You can define the following calculated attribute:

| No | Operation | Param1 | Param2 | Param3 |
|----|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 10 | GETREF | REF:Customer | ATTRIB:DefaultPaymentTermDays |

**Explanation:**

- GETREF - gets information from a related entity. The related entity is specified in **Param1**. The desired information is specified in **Param2**.
- Line number 10 is the only line in the calculated attribute
- The return value is the value of the attribute **DefaultPaymentTermDays** in the customer entity.

#### Example 2 - Complex filter and summation

The following calculated attribute sums all sales order lines, the product of which:

- has a user data attribute called 'CustPropPrj', equal to '500'
- has a name containing the word 'Tool'

| No | Operation | Param1 | Param2 | Param3 |
|----|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 10 | SUM | EXP:20 | ATTRIB:LineAmount |
| 20 | FILTER | CHILD:Lines | EXP:30 |
| 30 | IN | ATTRIB:Product | EXP:40 |
| 40 | FILTER | QUERY:Gen_Products | EXP:50 |
| 50 | AND | EXP:60 | EXP:70 |
| 60 | EQUALS | ATTRIB:CustPropPrj | CONST:500 |
| 70 | LIKE | ATTRIB:Name | CONST:'Tool' |

**Explanation:**

- Line 10: Iterates through the data set, specified on Line 20 (EXP:20), then SUMs the attribute **LineAmount**.
- Line 20: Filters the lines subset with the filter, specified in Line 30 (EXP:30).
- Line 30: Creates a filter, which will be satisfied only by products, specified in the query on Line 40 (EXP:40).
- Line 40: Creates a query, which filters the products with the condition, specified on Line 50.
- Line 50: Specifies that the condition is comprised of two conditions, linked with **AND**.
- Line 60: Specifies that the first condition is the value of an attribute called 'CustPropPrj' should be '500'.
- Line 70: Specifies that the second condition is that the name of the product should contain 'Tool'.

This example demonstrates how attributes can calculate very complicated formulas, query the database, get related values, etc.
