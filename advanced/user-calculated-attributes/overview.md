# User Calculated Attributes

User Calculated Attributes are user-defined objects, which extend the system entities.
Calculated attributes are defined like formulas.
When the value of a calculated attribute is requested, it is calculated "on the fly", in real time.

> [!NOTE]
> Calculated attribute formulas are compiled to native executable format.
> Their calculation speed is very similar to the speed of the system defined calculated attributes.
