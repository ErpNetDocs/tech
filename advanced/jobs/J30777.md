**Important notes:**

-  The *Document Type* field is **NOT** a filter for the job. If you set a specific document type, it doesn't mean that it'll be executed only for documents with this document type or entity. The filters meant to determine the processed documents are found in the *Conditions* field.
-  The *Conditions* field is the **only** one that's taken into account when determining which documents will be processed. If there are no conditions, the system will try to process **all** documents into the database!
-  In *Conditions*, you have to choose and specify the right combination of **criteria** which will filter the desired set of documents among all documents in the system.
Commonly used filters would be:
           
    - Document.Void = false - the job will **exclude** voided documents.
    - Document.Entity Name - the job will be **executed** for all documents of this entity.
    - Document.Document Type - the job will be **executed** for all documents of this document type/s.
    - Document.State - the job will be **executed** for all documents with this document state.
    - Document.User State - the job will be **executed** for all documents with this user state.
    - Document.Document Date >= and Document.Document Date >= - the job will be **executed** for all documents with document date in this period.
  
Currently, the only conditions taken into account are the filters from the **Document** panel.
