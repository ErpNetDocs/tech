# Additional amounts 

Additional amounts are a mechanism for reporting financial amounts in documents that **aren't** contained in document rows and/or **don't** represent measurement of the main purpose of the document. 

This main purpose is written in document rows or in the document header. For example:

- product price or product cost (goods or services), which is sold or bought;
- enterprise company asset price or cost (fixed, financial or rental);
- value/amount of monetary transaction (transfer, payment or obligation).

The amounts listed above are base amounts in documents and they are **NOT** additional.

It's not proper to report document amounts along with the main purpose. 

Otherwise, they appear as **secondary** effect of the main document purpose. 

Here are some examples:

- **VAT (and other taxes)** - taxes are not products an enterprise company is selling, producing or supplying; that's why they're usually reported as additional amounts in the documents;

- **VAT deviation** - this special amount is used for equalization of the VAT in store sales (because of specific roundings); this amount is additional because it's used to obtain the legal rate of the VAT.

- **Taxes (as customs)** - the same principles as in taxes are applied;

- **Discounts** - some types of customer discounts are represented as additional amounts when the discount can't be entered in a specific document row or there are no active promotions or bonus programs which control the discount;

- **Increases and decreases** -  the same principle as in discounts: if the increases and/or decreases can't be defined in the rows or as part of a sale instrument, such as promotional programs or bonus packages, they're entered as additional amounts;

- **Commissions (and other internal mechanisms for payments or money accounting)** - if used as additional amounts, they can represent a percentage of the document amount and the result can be used for recording internal company performance or personal employee indicators.
