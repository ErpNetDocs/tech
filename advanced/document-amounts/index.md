# Additiona amounts 

The additional amounts are a mechanism for reporting financial amounts in documents that are not contained by the document rows and/or do not represent measurement of the main purpose of the document. 
The main purpose is written in the document rows or in the document header. For example:

- product price or product cost (goods or services), which is sold or bought;
- enterprise company asset price or cost (fixed, financial or rental);
- value/amount of monetary transaction (transfer, payment or obligation).

The amounts listed above are base amounts in documents and they are NOT additional.

The **document amounts** are not proper to be reported along with the main document purpose or they are secondary effect of the main document purpose. 
These are some examples:

- VAT (and other taxes) - taxes, like VAT, are not products which the enterprise company is selling, producing or supplying; b–µcause of this the taxes are usually reported as additional amounts in the documents;
- VAT deviation - this is special amount used for equalization of the VAT in the store sales (because of specific roundings); this amount is addition because it is used to obtain the legal rate of the VAT.
- taxes (as customs) - the same principals as in the taxes are applied;
- discounts - some types of customer discounts are represented as additional amounts; they are entered as additional amounts when the discount cannot be entered in a specific document row or there are no active promotions or bonus programs, which control this discount;
- increases and decreases -  the same principle is applied as in discounts; if the increases and/or decreases cannot be defined in the rows or as part of a sale instrument such as promotional programs or bonus packages, than they are entered as additional amounts;
- commissions (and other internal mechanisms for payments or money accounting) - commissions and similar can be entered as additional amounts too; if they are used as additional amounts, they can represent a percent of the document amount and the result can be used for recording internal company performance indicators or personal employees indicators.
