# Additional amounts 

Additional amounts are a mechanism for reporting financial amounts in documents that **aren't** contained in document lines and/or **don't** represent measurement of the main purpose of the document. 

This main purpose is written in document lines or in the document header. An example of amounts reletaed to the main purpose are:
- product price or product cost of a product (goods or services), which is sold or bought;
- enterprise company asset price or cost (fixed, financial or rental);
- value/amount of monetary transaction (transfer, payment or obligation).

The amounts listed above are base amounts in documents and they are **NOT** additional.

Additional amounts, on the other hand, are amounts that should not be indicated together with the main activity or are **secondary** effect of the main document purpose. 
Here are some examples:

- **VAT (and other taxes)** - taxes are not products an enterprise company is selling, producing or supplying; that's why they're usually reported as additional amounts in the documents;

- **VAT deviation** - this special amount is used for equalization of the VAT in store sales (because of specific roundings); this amount is additional because it's used to obtain the legal rate of the VAT.

- **Taxes (as customs)** - the same principles as in taxes are applied;

- **Discounts** - some types of customer discounts are represented as additional amounts when the discount can't be entered in a specific document row or there are no active promotions or bonus programs which control the discount;

- **Increases and decreases** -  the same principle as in discounts: if the increases and/or decreases can't be defined in the rows or as part of a sale instrument, such as promotional programs or bonus packages, they're entered as additional amounts;

- **Commissions (and other internal mechanisms for payments or money accounting)** - if used as additional amounts, they can represent a percentage of the document amount and the result can be used for recording internal company performance or personal employee indicators.
