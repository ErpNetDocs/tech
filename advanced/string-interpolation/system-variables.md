# System variables

System variables are an essential part of @@name string interpolation. They provide additional kind of data, **unrelated** to a specific object or its state. For example, if you need to get the current date, you can do it directly via the system variable `$date`.

Each system variable starts with `$`, which identifies it as such, and must be surrounded by curly brackets `{ }`. 

`{$date}` is a legitimate system variable selector (or expression) which will evaluate to the current date.

There are also system variables with values depending on specific context, like the current transaction or a specific application. They're evaluated via an externally provided **resolver**. 

Below, you can find all system variables, their return type and the resolvers by which they're supported.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> If a system variable doesn't exist, it won't be evaluated and its expression will be returned **untouched**. <br> `{$non-existing-variable}` will evalaute to the same thing- `{$non-existing-variable}`. <br> In contrast, existing system variables with a null value will evaluate to an **empty string**.
