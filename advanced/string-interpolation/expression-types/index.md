# Interpolation expression types

A string is subject to interpolation and treated as a set of multiple discrete expressions. After each one is evaluated, the resulting value replaces its corresponding expression definition in the input string. 

There are several **types** of interpolation expressions, depending on the type of acquired data and the way it's obtained. Currently, @@name supports:

- **[Constant](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/string-interpolation/expression-types/constant.html)**
- **[Data member](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/string-interpolation/expression-types/data-member.html)**
- **[System variable](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/string-interpolation/expression-types/system-variable.html)**
- **[Entity](https://docs.erp.net/tech/advanced/string-interpolation/expression-types/entity.html)**
