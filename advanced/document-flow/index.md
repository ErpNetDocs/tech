# Document flow

The sequence of documents in a process forms a **document flow**. Just a sequence of documents is a rare occurrence, so documents in a process are more likely to be in a **hierarchy**.

Documents in @@name often have **sub-documents**. 

Most of the time, they're **[automatically generated](generation.md)** or created by some **[fulfillment function](fulfillment.md)**. 

However, manually entering a sub-document is also allowed and sometimes encouraged.

Documents and sub-documents can **form** a sequence, or hierarchy. The document flow design, therefore, is one of the most important aspects of implementing @@name for a target enterprise.

The design is achieved with the help of specific **routes** built for each document type.
