# FAIL

Usually used to include additional validations in the system -  validations which are currently not implemented in the system. The FAIL  syntax is simple - the user just set that the current business rule  throws an error. He is also able to set the error text as a constant.  The constant may be entered as first parameter type and value.

***For example:*** 

ActionNo: **1**; Action Type: **FAIL;** Parameter1 Type: **Constant**; Parameter1 Value: **'error message text'**.
