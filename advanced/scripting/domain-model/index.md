# Domain Model

Scripts in @@name can directly interact with the @@name [Domain Model](https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/index.html), providing access to all entities and their properties.

This allows you to read, create, update, and delete data as part of your custom logic.

Through the scripting interface, you work with the same Domain Model objects used throughout @@name, making it possible to automate operations, enforce complex rules, or integrate data from different parts of your instance.

With direct @@name Domain Model access, scripts can:

- Retrieve existing records and entity collections.

- Create and initialize new entities.

- Update properties of entities.

- Delete entities when necessary.
