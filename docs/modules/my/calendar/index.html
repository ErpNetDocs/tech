<h1 id="calendar">Calendar</h1>

<p>The ERP.net Calendar is a powerful time-management tool, allowing you to efficiently organize, monitor and synchronize your events and tasks. Its features include previewing and creating <strong>activities</strong>, applying different <strong>views</strong>, navigating across various <strong>time periods</strong>, as well as accessing any type of <strong>scheduled event</strong> easily.</p>
<p>It also sums up group activities from the <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/groups/features-in-groups.html#calendar">social groups</a></strong> you take part in.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/new_calendar_overview.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<h3 id="views">Views</h3>
<p>The Calendar has several <strong>views</strong> allowing you to narrow down your activities to the ones you have for the current day, week, or month(s), or even see them spread across the year's quarters.</p>
<p>You can <strong>change</strong> your view at any time by clicking the respective <strong>dropdown menu</strong> and selecting one of the other views.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/new_calendar_view.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can do so from the <strong>three-dot menu</strong> at the upper-right part of the page.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/calendar_view_modes.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h4 id="month">Month</h4>
<p>By default, the <strong>Month</strong> view is applied, showing the days of the current month in squares fitting the activities in each.</p>
<p>Each week is labeled with its corresponding <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/calendar.html#business-week-number">Business Week (BW) number</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/calendar_month.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h4 id="workweek">Workweek</h4>
<p>The <strong>Workweek</strong> view lists all activities for all days of the current week.</p>
<p>Each week is labeled with its corresponding <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/calendar.html#business-week-number">Business Week (BW) number</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/calendar_week.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h4 id="timeline">Timeline</h4>
<p>The <strong>Timeline</strong> view focuses on continuity across multiple time spans.</p>
<p>It allows you to track activities over longer periods of time and in a linear format, offering visibility of overlapping or consecutive activities.</p>
<p>There are several timeline modes available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Timeline – by Day</strong> – Displays all activities for a single day, as well as the activities for the next 11 days.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/timelineday.png" alt="picture"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline – by Week</strong> – Shows all activities for the current as well as the next six weeks. Each week is labeled with its <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/calendar.html#business-week-number">BW number</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/timelineweek.png" alt="picture"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline – by Month</strong> – Lists all activities for the current as well as the next six months.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/timelinemonth.png" alt="picture"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline – by Quarter</strong> – Presents all activities for the last three months (current quarter), as well as the next three quarters.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/timelinequarter.png" alt="picture"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>Regardless of the Calendar view, using either the <strong>left (previous)</strong> or <strong>right (next)</strong> arrows in the navigation bar, you can navigate across quarters, months, weeks and days. This allows you to revisit past activities or preview incoming ones.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/calendar_switch_monthss.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>The arrows within the Calendar itself move forward or go back <strong>by a single day</strong> in Month view and <strong>by a single period</strong> in Timeline view.</p>
<p>For example, pressing the <strong>right arrow</strong> advances one business week in <strong>Timeline - by Week</strong>, shifting all the weeks following it by one.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/timelinearrows.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="date-picker">Date picker</h3>
<p>You can navigate to a <strong>specific week or month</strong> from the blue-colored menu.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>date picker</strong> to select any given date, month, or year.</p>
<p>If you've navigated too far away and wish to quickly go back to the present date, simply click <strong>Today</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/calendar_mini.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h2 id="business-week-number">Business Week number</h2>
<p>The Calendar follows the ERP.net <strong>Business Week (BW) standard</strong> for numbering weeks in a calendar year. This standard is based on <strong>ISO 8601</strong>, but it applies specific improvements to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure weeks always align with their calendar year</li>
<li>prevent confusion in reports or documents where dates at the beginning or end of a year may be assigned to a different year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the two key differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Month</th>
<th>ISO 8601</th>
<th>Business Week</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>January</td>
<td>The first 1–3 days of January may belong to the last week of the previous year (<strong>e.g. 01.01.2027 → ISO 53/2026</strong>) ⚠️</td>
<td>These days are assigned to <strong>week 0 of the current year</strong> (<strong>e.g. 01.01.2027 → BW 0/2027</strong>) ✅</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>December</td>
<td>The last days of December may belong to Week 1 of the next year (<strong>e.g. 31.12.2018 → ISO 1/2019</strong>) ⚠️</td>
<td>These days remain in the <strong>final week of the current year</strong> (<strong>e.g. 31.12.2018 → BW 53/2018</strong>) ✅</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The BW number <strong>always reflects the actual calendar year of the date</strong>. This avoids mismatches across year boundaries, ensures chronological order, and keeps all documents and reports from a given year grouped correctly.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/business_week_monthvieww.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="monthly-and-weekly-labels">Monthly and weekly labels</h3>
<p>Within the Calendar, you can see each week labeled with its corresponding <strong>BW number</strong>, which stands for &quot;Business Week number&quot;.</p>
<p>In <strong>Workweek</strong> view, this label is positioned at the upper-left corner of the Calendar.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/business_week_view.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>In other Calendar views as well as navigators making use of the <strong>date picker</strong>, you will also find BW labels for convenience.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/bw_datepicker.png" alt="picture"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>All ERP.net navigators with time-based columns like Document Date support <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/webclient/introduction/navigator-features.html?q=features#grouping">business week grouping</a></strong>, which allows you to group any records of documents by the business week they were created in.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>Your activities are summarized and displayed within the Calendar, with their titles fitting into the respective time slots.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>If you hover the mouse over an existing activity, you can see more <strong>details</strong> about it in a tooltip.</p>
<p>This includes the <strong>Subject</strong>, <strong>time range</strong>, <strong>Responsible Party</strong>, <strong>Target Party</strong>, and <strong>Document Type</strong>.</p>
<p>If participants are included, up to the first three will be listed under a dedicated &quot;<strong>Participants</strong>&quot; section.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/activity_details.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>In Month view, the <strong>starting time</strong> of an activity is always shown to the left of its title.</p>
<p>You can also see a <strong>list of all activities</strong> for a given day by clicking the <strong>circular button</strong> at the top-right corner of a date.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/activities_fortheday.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="scope-of-activities">Scope of activities</h3>
<p>As a general rule, the Calendar shows you all activities where you are designated as the <strong>Owner</strong>, <strong>Responsible Party</strong> or a <strong>Participant</strong>.</p>
<p>The Calendar will also display activities from <strong><a href="groups/features-in-groups.md">social groups</a></strong> you take part in. You once again need to be either the Owner, Responsible Party or a Participant. If you're neither of those, you will still see the actvities but only within the <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/groups/features-in-groups.html#activity-access">group-integrated Calendar</a></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="create-an-activity">Create an activity</h3>
<p>To add a new activity from scratch, click on a date and press the <strong>Create</strong> button.</p>
<p>It will expand a dropdown with several activity types.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/create_activity.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>Once you make your choice, you will be taken to the <strong>Activity document form</strong> where you need to fill out all the necessary fields regarding the activity and individuals who may be involved in it.</p>
<p>These fields also serve as crucial piece of data that will appear in all potential participants' Calendars.</p>
<h3 id="edit-an-activity">Edit an activity</h3>
<p>You can open any activity document by clicking on its title. Inside, you can <strong>edit</strong> the subject, date, participants or any other information.</p>
<p>When done, you need to once again click <strong>Save and reload</strong>. Your changes will be immediately reflected in your Calendar.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/editt_event.png" alt="picture"></p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p><strong>The Calendar is not tied to one specific location</strong>. <br>
Apart from being able to interact with it in a <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/my/groups/features-in-groups.html#calendar">group-specific context</a></strong>, you can also integrate it as a panel in the <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</p>
