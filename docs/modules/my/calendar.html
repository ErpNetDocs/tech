<h1 id="my-calendar">My Calendar</h1>

<p>The <strong>ERP.net Calendar</strong> is a powerful time-management tool, allowing you to efficiently organize, monitor and synchronize your personal activities and tasks.</p>
<p>It also sums up group activities from the <strong><a href="groups/features-in-groups.html">social groups</a></strong> you take part in, whenever you are marked as the responsible person, organizer, or a participant.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/new_calendar_overview.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<h3 id="views">Views</h3>
<p>The Calendar has several <strong>views</strong> allowing you to narrow down your activities to the current day, week, or month(s), or even see them spread across the year's quarters.</p>
<p>By default, the <strong>Month</strong> view is applied, showing the days of the current month and the activities in it, but you can change it at any time.</p>
<p>Simply click on the dropdown menu and select one of the other views.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/new_calendar_view.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>Using either the <strong>left (previous)</strong> or <strong>right (next)</strong> <strong>arrows</strong>, you can navigate across quarters, months, weeks and days.</p>
<p>This allows you to revisit past activities or preview incoming ones.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/calendar_switch_monthss.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>Depending on your current view, you can navigate to a specific week or month from the blue-colored menu.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>date picker</strong> to select a specific date, month, or year.</p>
<p>If you've navigated away and wish to return to the present date, simply click <strong>Today</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/calendar_mini.png" alt="picture"></p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You can also change the Calendar display view from the <strong>three-dot menu</strong> at the upper-right part of the page.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="pictures/calendar_view_modes.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h2 id="business-week-numbering">Business week numbering</h2>
<p>The ERP.net Calendar employs the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 standard</a></strong> for tracking the number of weeks of a calendar year:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last week of the previous year is <strong>always marked with the number corresponding to that year</strong> (e.g. week 52 of 2023)</li>
<li>The first week of the next year is <strong>always marked with the number corresponding to that year</strong> (e.g. week 1 of 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when the last ISO week of the previous year falls into the first three days of the next year, it is <strong>always marked as week 0 for the new year</strong>.</p>
<p>This way, the Calendar treats January 1st as the true beginning of a year, yet still respects the ISO standard from Week 1 onward.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/week_zero.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="monthly-and-weekly-notation">Monthly and weekly notation</h3>
<p>Within the Calendar, you can see each week labeled with its corresponding <strong>BW number</strong>, which stands for &quot;Business Week number&quot;.</p>
<p>In <strong>Workweek</strong> view, this label is positioned at the upper-left corner of the Calendar, clearly showing which week of the year this is.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/business_week_view.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>In <strong>Month</strong> view, the labels are positioned vertically on the left of the Calendar, and their number depends on how many weeks the month has.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/business_week_monthvieww.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>In other Calendar views as well as ERP.net navigators making use of the <strong>date picker</strong>, you will also find BW labels.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/business_week_mini.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>Your activities are summarized and displayed within the Calendar, with their titles fitting into the respective time slots.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>If you hover the mouse over an existing activity, you can see more <strong>details</strong> about it in a pop-up.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/activity_details.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>In Month view, the <strong>starting time</strong> of an activity is always shown to the left of its title.</p>
<p>It is also possible to see a <strong>list of all activities</strong> for a given day by clicking the <strong>circular button</strong> at the top-right corner of a date.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/activities_fortheday.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="scope-of-activities">Scope of activities</h3>
<p>As a general rule, the Calendar shows you all activities where you are designated as the <strong>Owner</strong>, <strong>Responsible Party</strong> or a <strong>Participant</strong>.</p>
<p>The Calendar will also show activities from <strong>social groups</strong> you take part in. If a member from your organization is not part of the same groups as you are, they will not be able to see nor access your group events, and vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="create-an-activity">Create an activity</h3>
<p>To add a new activity from scratch, click on a date and press the <strong>Create</strong> button.</p>
<p>It will expand a dropdown with several options, including a meeting, task or even sick day.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/create_activity.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>Once you make your choice, you will be taken to the <strong>Activity document form</strong> where you need to fill out all the necessary fields regarding the activity and individuals who may be involved in it.</p>
<p>These fields also serve as crucial piece of data that will appear in all intended participants' Calendars.</p>
<p>You can add a <strong>Subject</strong>, <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>End Time</strong>, as well as a <strong>Responsible Party</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Screenshot_8.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>When you're finished, click <strong>Save and reload</strong>, and the activity will be added to your <strong>Calendar</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="edit-activity">Edit activity</h2>
<p>You can open any activity by clicking on its title.</p>
<p>Inside the document, you can change the subject, date or any other aspect.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/activity_document.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>Upon saving the changes, they will be immediately reflected in the Calendar.</p>
<h2 id="broader-use">Broader use</h2>
<p>The Calendar is not confined to a single location.</p>
<p>In the ERP.net <strong>Dashboard</strong>, for instance, you can integrate it as a panel, accessible whenever needed.</p>
