<h1 id="product-relation-types">Product Relation Types</h1>

<p>The Product Relation Types framework defines a unified and extensible model for representing various relationships between products within the system.
Its main purpose is to allow consistent storage, management, and functional use of product-to-product relations such as replacements, compatibility, merchandising, and other custom links.</p>
<p>In other words, it provides a single, structured way to describe how products relate to each other — functionally, commercially, or technically.</p>
<h1 id="system-type-relations">System Type Relations</h1>
<h2 id="1-generic-gen">1. Generic (GEN)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Description:
A general or neutral link between two products without any built-in business logic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expected behavior:
The system only stores and displays the relation; no automatic actions are triggered.
Used for free associations or for future relation types that don’t fit into other categories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-replacement-rpl">2. Replacement (RPL)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Description:
Defines a relation where one product can replace another.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expected behavior:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should provide one-click replacement in all processes where a product is selected (e.g., SalesOrder, WorkOrder).
When a product is discontinued, invalid, or out of stock, the system automatically suggests a valid replacement (ToProduct).
The Qty_Factor field is used to calculate adjusted quantities during replacement (e.g., 1 X = 2 Y).
Relation validity is controlled by FromDate and ToDate.
Can be used to model a supersession chain — tracking product replacements over time.</p>
<h2 id="3-merchandising-mrc">3. Merchandising (MRC)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Description:
A relation for commercial or marketing purposes — e.g., upsell, cross-sell, similarity, or accessories.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expected behavior:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should use these relations to automatically suggest related products in the UI (Product Details, Cart, Sales screens, etc.).
Subtypes can be defined via the Code field (e.g., UPSELL, CROSSSELL, SIMILAR).
Relations can be time-bound using FromDate and ToDate (e.g., seasonal campaigns).
Data can also be used for analytics such as attach rate, conversion uplift, and similar KPIs.</p>
<h2 id="4-fitment-fit">4. Fitment (FIT)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Description:
Defines compatibility between products — i.e., which products can be used together in configurations, technologies, or documents.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expected behavior:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a product is selected in a configuration, the system should filter or validate the available compatible products.
Relations can be one-directional or bi-directional depending on the domain logic.
Commonly used for verifying correctness in product recipes, technical documents, or assemblies.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-replacement-and-fitment">Understanding Replacement and Fitment</h2>
<p>You may stumble upon a pair of products and struggle with identifying their relation, as it would not definitiely be categorized as one type or the other at once.
For example there are these two products: Tyre model A, by manufacturer X, and Tyre model B, by manufacturer Y.
To determine the relation we need to clarify the semantic difference between Replacement and Fitment, even when they can coexist for the same pair of products.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aspect</th>
<th>Replacement RPL</th>
<th>Fitment FIT</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Meaning</td>
<td>Product A can be used instead of product B. They are functionally interchangeable for the same purpose.</td>
<td>Product A is compatible with product B or with a system/context that uses B. They work together, but not necessarily instead of one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Direction</td>
<td>Typically one-directional (A replaces B). May imply product lifecycle or equivalence.</td>
<td>Often bi-directional or contextual (A fits B, B fits A, or A fits into C).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>Old Tyre Model T100 → New Tyre Model T200 (same specs, new generation).</td>
<td>Tyre Model T200 fits on Vehicle Model X (defines compatibility).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Relations may overlap — two products can both fit the same system and replace each other.</strong></p>
<p>The same pair of products can simultaneously have both</p>
<ul>
<li>a FIT (Fitment) relation → because they fit the same technical context,</li>
<li>and a RPL (Replacement) relation → because one can substitute the other functionally.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fitment relation</em></p>
<p>Tyre A (Manufacturer X) and Tyre B (Manufacturer Y) may both fit the same vehicle or rim specification.
This means they are fitment-compatible — they serve the same functional context. Fitment (FIT): “can work with” → focuses on compatibility.</p>
<p><em>Replacement relation:</em></p>
<p>If Tyre A can be sold or used in place of Tyre B (e.g., same dimensions, load index, performance spec), then they can also have a Replacement relation between them.
Replacement (RPL): “can be used instead of” → focuses on interchangeability.</p>
<p>Modeling both relations explicitly keeps system logic clean and unambiguous.</p>
<h1 id="defining-companys-product-relation-types">Defining company's Product Relation Types</h1>
<p>Each organization has its own business-specific needs and may require finer distinctions or naming for product relations within these system categories.
This is where custom Product Relation Types come into play.</p>
<p>Defining your own relation types allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Describe relations more precisely - the system types define the behavior — but not the meaning. Custom types (via Code and Name) let you label relations according to your business context.
<br>Example: within RPL, you might define separate types for SUPERSESSION, ALTERNATIVE, or EQUIVALENT.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enable targeted system logic or reporting - you can filter, report, or automate processes based on your own defined type
<br>Example: only ALTERNATIVE replacements appear in offers, while SUPERSESSION replacements are applied automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support clear communication and governance - each type documents the intended purpose of a relationship, helping teams avoid confusion
<br>Example: differentiating “marketing accessories” from “technical accessories” under the same MRC category.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extend functionality without changing system code - new types can be added dynamically without database or code changes
<br>Example: If your business introduces bundle relations, you can simply define a new type BUNDLE under SystemType = MRC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
