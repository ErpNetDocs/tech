<h1 id="planned-reconcile">Planned Reconcile</h1>

<p>This section allows you to count and update product quantities available in a store based on an existing reconciliation.</p>
<p><strong>Planned reconcile</strong> is ideal for larger inventories where annual reconciliations or planned audits are performed for individual stores and product groups. It also makes the process more flexible by offering one of two <strong>reconciliation types</strong>.</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong><a href="quick-reconcile.html">Quick reconcile</a></strong> is designed for fast, on-the-spot reconciliations, even when minor discrepancies are observed.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/planned_reconc.png" alt="pictures"></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You need to have at least one existing Planned or Firm planned reconciliation to use this module.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-reconciliation">Create a reconciliation</h3>
<p>When creating a reconciliation, you need to select a <strong>Default Store</strong> for it, and optionally choose a <strong>Default Product Group</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Reconciliations_09_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>There are two <strong>types</strong> of reconciliation: <strong>Full</strong> and <strong>Partial</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on which one you choose, you can determine what happens with counted and not counted product quantities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Full</strong> - Products that are not counted are considered missing and will get a quantity of &quot;0&quot; assigned.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Partial</strong> - Products that are not counted are not reconciled and their availability will remain the same.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>If the Reconciliation Type is Full and a Default Product Group is assigned, uncounted quantities will be set to &quot;0&quot; <strong>only</strong> for products from that group.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Types_09_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>For a reconciliation to be recognized in <strong>Planned Reconcile</strong>, its state needs to <strong>Planned</strong> or <strong>Firm planned</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Planned_08_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>When you access <strong>Planned Reconcile</strong>, it will load a list of existing reconciliations filtered by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Their <strong>Enterprise Company</strong> and <strong>Enterprise Company Location</strong> are the ones the user is currently logged into.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All of them have a <strong>Default Store</strong> equivalent to the one selected for Inventory Control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each document's <strong>Date</strong> is no older than seven days prior to the current day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Documents not matching these conditions will <strong>not</strong> be visualized.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Inventory_control_view_08_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If a reconciliation has a <strong>Default Product Group</strong> assigned, it will be named by it. If not, its name will be replaced by a dash.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p><strong>Planned Reconcile</strong> is composed of three tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Availability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Counted</strong></li>
<li><strong>Info</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>
<p>This is where all of your store products are listed, together with their currently available quantities.</p>
<p>If the reconciliation has a <strong>Default Product Group</strong> assigned, only products belonging to that group will be shown.</p>
<p>In that case, attempting to scan a product from another product group will result in an <strong>error</strong> being thrown.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Availability_08_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="counted">Counted</h3>
<p>Here, you can find how many quantities of the products have been <strong>counted</strong>.</p>
<p>Each count operation will have its own line, and the newest one will be positioned at the top.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Counted_08_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="info">Info</h3>
<p>This tab includes details about the products, including additional codes, if present, as well as the total counted quantities up to this moment and the ability to <strong>delete</strong> them. If you tap on a product from the <strong>Availability</strong> tab, you'll be shown further information about it here.</p>
<p>All registered counts feature the <strong>date and time</strong> when they occured, and can be individually <strong>deleted</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Time_08_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h2 id="scanning">Scanning</h2>
<p>In order to count quantities of products in Planned Reconcile, you need to use the <strong>Scan</strong> field.</p>
<p>It lets you quickly insert the instances of a product you want to <strong>count</strong> either manually or through <strong><a href="command-list.html">barcode commands</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with the process of scanning a product and require assistance, refer to our <strong><a href="index.html">Inventory Control overview</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Planned_Reconciliation_Scan_08_07.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="common-features">Common features</h3>
<p>Just like in <strong><a href="quick-reconcile.html">Quick Reconcile</a></strong>, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>scan product quantities <strong>higher</strong> than the currently available ones</p>
</li>
<li><p>introduce product quantities that <strong>haven't</strong> been previously counted</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-counts">Zero counts</h3>
<p>You can count <strong>zero</strong> quantities of products as many times as needed without changing the total counted quantity up to this moment.</p>
<p>This will result in <strong>new lines</strong> being created.</p>
<p>If the only count is &quot;0&quot;, then the quantity of the product will be zero in the final reconciliation document.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/zero_count.png" alt="picture"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If you leave <strong>Planned Reconcile</strong> in the middle of counting, your progress will be saved. <br> This applies even if you begin other operations within <strong><a href="index.html">Inventory Control</a></strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="parallel-counting">Parallel counting</h2>
<p>Multiple workers can <strong>simultaneously</strong> count product quantities for the same reconciliation.</p>
<p>Once another worker logs in, they can start counting their own counts within the same document.</p>
<p>This is <strong>independent</strong> from previously started counts - every user will see only the quantities that they have counted.</p>
<h2 id="calculate-reconciliation-based-on-the-counts">Calculate reconciliation based on the counts</h2>
<p>Once you are done counting product quantities, click <strong>Close</strong>. This will bring you back to the main Inventory Control application.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/close.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>Store managers responsible for completing the reconciliation procedure need to navigate to the respective reconciliation within the <strong>Inventory</strong> module.</p>
<p>Inside, the <strong>Counts</strong> panel will have reflected all counted instances of the products, revealing further information about each, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Creation Time Utc</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Creation User</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Product</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Quantity</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Here, the manager will see all counted quantities from different users. <br>
These quantities can be <strong>edited</strong> manually from here, if needed.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="pictures/counts_panel.png" alt="picture"></p>
<p>Using a <strong>UI function</strong>, you can consolidate individual quantity counts from the <strong>Counts</strong> panel into summarized lines in the <strong>Lines</strong> panel.</p>
<p>This ensures that products counted in the same store are <strong>automatically</strong> summed up or represented by a zero quantity, depending on the selected reconciliation type (Partial or Full).</p>
