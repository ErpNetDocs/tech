<h1 id="warehouse-policies">Warehouse policies</h1>

<p>Warehouse policies are a hierarchical system for applying policies when working with the WMS module.</p>
<p>The most important properties that any policy has are policy kind and value. Policy kinds are predifined system types, which specify the usage of the policy.
Different policy kinds have different effect on the system. Some kinds manage certain restrictions during the operations execution of operations, others affect the WMS Worker app's interface, while others store important values that are used by the calculation algorithms.</p>
<p>Warehouse policies can be set up for different warehouses, zones or even product groups, depening on the meaning of the kind of the particular policy. We can also specify if one policy is more important than another policy of the same kind, which compliments the hierarchical structure of the policies and allows flexibility.</p>
<h1 id="available-policy-kinds">Available policy kinds</h1>
<p>Policy kinds specify what the actual action of the policy is.</p>
<p>The list of the policy kinds is system predifined.</p>

A quantity of 1 PCE will not be entered and the quantity is expected to be entered in the quantity screen.<br><br> Note: If more quantity is scanned, for example, 300 PCE (300*), and then the barcode is scanned, the accepted quantity will be 300 PCE. But this has always happened regardless of the policy value.</td>

There won't be any considerations about the availability of the locations, except for the zero quantities. <br><br> If there is an applicable policy to the Warehouse and its value is „smart“ or there is no defined policy, then default behavior is used.

<h1 id="applicability">Applicability</h1>
<p>You set up each warehouse policy by defining the conditions where it applies, to which products and for how long.</p>
<p>Each warehouse policy can apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Warehouse</p>
</li>
<li><p>Zone and its sub-zones</p>
</li>
<li><p>Product group and its sub-groups</p>
</li>
<li><p>Product type</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Some policies can be applied only at the warehouse or zone level.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="importance">Importance</h1>
<p>Policies have importance. When evaluating a policy, the setting with the highest importance is applied.</p>
<p>For example, if a policy is applied to a root zone and to a sub-zone, the importance of the sub-zone setting determines which setting will be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the sub-zone setting has higher priority, it will be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be used for hierarchical application of policies for zones.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the root zone setting has higher priority, it will be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be used for root zone (or even warehouse level) setting, which overrides the setting for specific zones.</p>
<p>Importance is an integer value, allowing even negative numbers (for very low importance).</p>
