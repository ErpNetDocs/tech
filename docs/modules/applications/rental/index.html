<h1 id="rental">Rental</h1>

<p>The <strong>Rental</strong> section is designed to oversee and control the leasing process of all owned and re-leased assets.</p>
<p>Located in the <strong>Applications</strong> module, it is divided into various panels, each serving a specific function to ensure effective management of assets, documents, and transactions.</p>
<p>By providing a structured approach as well as the ability to generate detailed reports, <strong>Rental</strong> offers a comprehensive aid to all rental-related processes and operations.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Rental is referred to as <strong>Lease-Out Management</strong> in the ERP.net Desktop Client. <br><br>
For the purposes of this overview, screenshots and references will be used from the Desktop Client.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="pictures/Lease_out_view_25_06.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>There are two types of assets which you can create and manage through Rental:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rental assets</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consumables</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In the context of a rental asset, a consumable typically refers to items or materials that are used up and need to be replaced regularly as part of the asset's operation or maintenance.</p>
<p>Consumables are tied to a rental asset but are treated as products distinct from it. They are <strong>sold</strong> and not returned, while the rental asset itself is <strong>leased</strong> for a specific period of time, and is therefore expected to be returned in reusable condition.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Each rental asset can also be categorized as a <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/tech/modules/applications/enterprise-asset-management/index.html#managed-assets">Managed Asset</a></strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="documents">Documents</h2>
<p>The <strong>Documents</strong> portion of Rental contains all essential transactions and contracts related to the leasing process.</p>
<p>It provides a centralized repository for managing lease agreements and transaction records, ensuring their easy access and organization.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lease contract</strong>  - the main lease document containing the rental asset/s and its consumables, if such are applicable; it also includes the lease time period negotiated for every rental asset</li>
<li><strong>Transaction (Deliver)</strong> - a protocol confirming the handover of the rental asset; it contains the start date of the negotiated lease period</li>
<li><strong>Transaction (Receive)</strong> - a protocol confirming the return of the rental asset; it contains the end date of the negotiated lease period</li>
<li><strong>Transaction (Write Off Not Returned)</strong> - a protocol confirming that the rental asset has not been returned by the leaser</li>
<li><strong>Transaction (Status Report)</strong> - a protocol describing the rental assets handed over to a leaser (can be used for inspection).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="pictures/Lease_out_documents_25_06.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="document-flow">Document flow</h3>
<p>A typical document flow for leasing out rental assets with consumables goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lease Contract --&gt; Transaction (Deliver), Transaction (Receive), Sales Order (Rent), Sales Order (Consumable)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon release, the lease contract will lead to the simultaneous generation of a transaction (deliver) protocol, a transaction (receive) protocol, a sales order accounting for the rent, and a sales order accounting for the consumable(s).</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Like all other ERP.net modules, Rental allows you to set up a personalized document flow that meets the individual needs of your business or organization.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="rent-lease-contracts-navigator">Rent Lease Contracts Navigator</h3>
<p>This navigator contains all existing <strong>lease contract agreements</strong> issued for rental assets, including those for consumables, and offers the ability to create new ones.</p>
<p>It is also equipped with a handful of <strong>filtering capabilities</strong> designed to speed up the process of extracting information in a convenient and systematized way.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>When creating a lease contract, you can include as many rental assets in it as needed, and additionally fill out necessary data for each.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="transactions-navigator">Transactions Navigator</h3>
<p>Gives access to all <strong>protocols</strong> following or associated with a lease contract.</p>
<p>Like the Lease Contracts Navigator, it includes useful <strong>filtering capabilities</strong> through which you can quickly and easily summarize protocol data in a convenient format.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>This section includes <strong>tools</strong> that facilitate the day-to-day management of lease activities.</p>
<p>It offers functionalities that help you stay on track with key dates and schedules.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Lease_out_functions_25_06.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>
<p>The Calendar provides a quick overview of all rental assets' <strong>occupancy</strong>, showing you the customers to which they were leased, from when they have been leased and until when. It lets you know when they will be free to lease again, including the periods when they will not be leased.</p>
<h2 id="reports">Reports</h2>
<p>Rental allows you to generate comprehensive <strong>reports</strong> summarizing your leasing activities.</p>
<p>These include monitoring the status of assets, tracking lease contract details, and reviewing transaction history.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Lease_out_reports_25_06.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="assets-status-report">Assets status report</h3>
<p>Provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of all assets, revealing their current availability/occupancy.</p>
<h3 id="lease-contracts--lines">Lease Contracts – Lines</h3>
<p>Breaks down each lease contract into its lines, giving insights into contract terms and conditions.</p>
<h3 id="transactions--lines">Transactions – Lines</h3>
<p>Contains detailed records of all transactions, ensuring transparency and accountability in rental asset management.</p>
<h3 id="lease-contracts---lines--consumables">Lease Contracts - Lines – Consumables</h3>
<p>Focuses on the consumables purchased with rental assets.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>The <strong>Definitions</strong> portion of Rental provides detailed information about all rentable assets, their classifications and consumables.</p>
<p>It's here, for instance, that you can add new asset <strong>types</strong> and <strong>groups</strong> necessary for the creation of the rental asset itself.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Certain definitions can also be created during the process of filling out the lease contract. <br><br>
All the information you provide for a rental asset in advance of creating a lease contract will be automatically added in that contract's lines when you select the respective rental asset.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="pictures/Lease_out_definitions_25_06.png" alt="picture"></p>
<h3 id="rental-assets">Rental Assets</h3>
<p>This is where rental assets are created and stored. Each has a <strong>code</strong> and a <strong>name</strong> and must first be defined a <strong>group</strong> with a <strong>type</strong>.</p>
<p>It is necessary to associate it with an existing <strong>sales product</strong> for which a <strong>sales order</strong> will later be issued.</p>
<p>You can also specify additional information for the rental asset, including tying it to a <strong>fixed asset</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="asset-types">Asset Types</h3>
<p>Defines the various rental asset types which need to be tied to a rental asset group.</p>
<h3 id="asset-groups">Asset Groups</h3>
<p>Categorizes rental assets into hierarchies of larger groups.</p>
<h3 id="assets--consumables">Assets – Consumables</h3>
<p>This is where consumables are created and information for existing ones can be previewed.</p>
<p>Each consumable has a <strong>code</strong> and a <strong>name</strong> and must be defined a <strong>product</strong> with a certain <strong>quantity</strong>.</p>
<p>One or more quantities of a particular consumable are always tied to one rental asset a time.</p>
<h3 id="asset-types--consumables">Asset Types – Consumables</h3>
<p>Defines the different types of consumable items related to rental assets.</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> portion of Rental allows you to define or change individual properties and attributes of various asset types.</p>
<p>This includes different user characteristics and ensures a more custom approach to how you structure your rental assets.</p>
