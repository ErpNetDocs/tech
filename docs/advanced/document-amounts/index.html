<h1 id="additional-amounts">Additional amounts</h1>

<p><strong>Additional amounts</strong> are a mechanism for reporting financial amounts in documents that <strong>aren't</strong> contained in document lines and/or <strong>don't</strong> represent measurement of the main purpose of the document.</p>
<p>This main purpose is written in document lines or in the document header. An example of amounts reletaed to the main purpose are:</p>
<ul>
<li>product price or product cost of a product (goods or services), which is sold or bought;</li>
<li>enterprise company asset price or cost (fixed, financial or rental);</li>
<li>value/amount of monetary transaction (transfer, payment or obligation).</li>
</ul>
<p>The amounts listed above are base amounts in documents and they are <strong>NOT</strong> additional.</p>
<p><br>Additional amounts, on the other hand, are amounts that should not be indicated together with the main activity or are <strong>secondary</strong> effect of the main document purpose.
Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>VAT (and other taxes)</strong> - taxes are not products an enterprise company is selling, producing or supplying; that's why they're usually reported as additional amounts in the documents;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>VAT deviation</strong> - this special amount is used for equalization of the VAT in store sales (because of specific roundings); this amount is additional because it's used to obtain the legal rate of the VAT.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Taxes (as customs)</strong> - the same principles as in taxes are applied;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Discounts</strong> - some types of customer discounts are represented as additional amounts when the discount can't be entered in a specific document row or there are no active promotions or bonus programs which control the discount;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increases and decreases</strong> -  the same principle as in discounts: if the increases and/or decreases can't be defined in the rows or as part of a sale instrument, such as promotional programs or bonus packages, they're entered as additional amounts;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commissions (and other internal mechanisms for payments or money accounting)</strong> - if used as additional amounts, they can represent a percentage of the document amount and the result can be used for recording internal company performance or personal employee indicators.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Additional amounts are used for different reasons, such as adding amounts to the main business activity in a document or reporting secondary measurements for a business or outside activities.</p>
<h4 id="calculating-the-amount-to-pay">Calculating the amount to pay</h4>
<p>Some additional amounts serve to calculate the <a href="../../modules/crm/sales/sales-concepts/amount-to-pay.html">amount-to-pay</a> for a document. This is marked in the definition by adding a check to the <em>Add To Customer</em> field. Usually, these are amounts like VAT, VAT deviation, discounts, increases, decreases.</p>
<h4 id="calculating-goods-cost">Calculating goods cost</h4>
<p>Additional amounts may be used to add value to the cost of the goods in the <a href="../../modules/logistics/index.html">Logistics</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if the transport is entered as an additional amount when goods are purchased, the transport value will be <strong>added</strong> to the purchase price. When a stock transfer from one store to another is executed and it includes transport cost added to the issued products, the value of this transport should be <strong>added</strong> to the products cost <strong>before</strong> they are received in the second store.</p>
<p>Adding transport to the purchase price or the store cost is done in the receiving store orders or store transactions. When a row in the sub-document is created, the value of this row is <strong>increased</strong> by the distribution in the current row amount of the transport.</p>
<p>The same procedure is applied to <strong>all</strong> additional amounts marked as part of the store cost calculation.</p>
<p>This is the <em>Add To Line</em> field in the definition of the additional amount.</p>
<h4 id="calculating-outside-activities">Calculating outside activities</h4>
<p>Additional amounts may also be used to report the external activities of an enterprise company.</p>
<p>For example, if a salesman in a company receives commission or other additions to their salaries equal to a percentage of the turnover they achieve, the commision may be entered as an additional amount in the sales order, which is a <strong>percentage</strong> of the amount to pay.</p>
